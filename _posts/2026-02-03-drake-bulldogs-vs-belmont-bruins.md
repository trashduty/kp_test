The early betting action has shaped into Belmont Bruins favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 154.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Belmont Bruins has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Drake Bulldogs needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Drake Bulldogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.54 (ranked #152 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Belmont Bruins** counter with 117.19 offensive efficiency (#50). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 40.6%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
