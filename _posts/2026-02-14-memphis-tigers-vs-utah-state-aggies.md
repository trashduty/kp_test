The early betting action has shaped into Utah State Aggies favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 153.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Memphis Tigers to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Utah State Aggies to play below their standard. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Memphis Tigers** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.49 (ranked #247 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Utah State Aggies** counter with 121.14 offensive efficiency (#18). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
