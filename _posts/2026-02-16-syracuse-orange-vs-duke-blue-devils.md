These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 19.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Syracuse Orange to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Duke Blue Devils to play below their standard.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Syracuse Orange** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.83 (ranked #147 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Duke Blue Devils** counter with 120.73 offensive efficiency (#19). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 34.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
