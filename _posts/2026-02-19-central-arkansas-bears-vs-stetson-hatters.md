These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Central Arkansas Bears has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Stetson Hatters needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Central Arkansas Bears** bring an offensive efficiency of 111.37 (ranked #110 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Stetson Hatters** counter with 102.66 offensive efficiency (#288). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
