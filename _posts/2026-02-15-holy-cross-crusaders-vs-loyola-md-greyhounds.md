These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 3.5-point spread indicates Loyola (MD) Greyhounds is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Holy Cross Crusaders has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Holy Cross Crusaders** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.77 (ranked #300 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Loyola (MD) Greyhounds** counter with 104.81 offensive efficiency (#248). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
