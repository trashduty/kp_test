These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Norfolk St Spartans's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

**Norfolk St Spartans** bring an offensive efficiency of 100.38 (ranked #315 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks** counter with 93.41 offensive efficiency (#359). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
