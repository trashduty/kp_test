These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 14.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking CSU Bakersfield Roadrunners to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires UC San Diego Tritons to play below their standard.

#### Offensive Firepower
**CSU Bakersfield Roadrunners** bring an offensive efficiency of 98.58 (ranked #338 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **UC San Diego Tritons** counter with 107.30 offensive efficiency (#198). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
