These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

The 5.5-point spread indicates Texas A&M-CC Islanders is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Incarnate Word Cardinals** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.41 (ranked #207 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Texas A&M-CC Islanders** counter with 99.52 offensive efficiency (#320). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
