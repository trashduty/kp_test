These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.0-point spread indicates Portland St Vikings is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Idaho Vandals has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Idaho Vandals** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.92 (ranked #140 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Portland St Vikings** counter with 106.98 offensive efficiency (#202). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
