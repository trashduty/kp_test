These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 12.0-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking UNC Greensboro Spartans to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Mercer Bears to play below their standard.

#### Offensive Firepower
**UNC Greensboro Spartans** bring an offensive efficiency of 107.80 (ranked #177 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Mercer Bears** counter with 115.52 offensive efficiency (#66). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
