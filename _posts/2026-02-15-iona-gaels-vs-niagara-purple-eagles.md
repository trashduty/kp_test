These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Iona Gaels is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Niagara Purple Eagles has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Iona Gaels** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.58 (ranked #231 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Niagara Purple Eagles** counter with 98.82 offensive efficiency (#330). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
