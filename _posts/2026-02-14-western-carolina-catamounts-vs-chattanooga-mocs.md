### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Western Carolina Catamounts (9-15) travels to face Chattanooga Mocs (10-16) at McKenzie Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Chattanooga Mocs favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 151.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Chattanooga Mocs's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Western Carolina Catamounts** bring an offensive efficiency of 108.33 (ranked #175 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Chattanooga Mocs** counter with 105.53 offensive efficiency (#231). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

#### The Interior Battle

Getting to the line matters too. Western Carolina Catamounts's free throw rate sits at 29.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Chattanooga Mocs check in at 32.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Western Carolina Catamounts convert 68.6% while Chattanooga Mocs hit 76.8%. Chattanooga Mocs's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
