These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Drake Bulldogs's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Bradley Braves** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.30 (ranked #158 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Drake Bulldogs** counter with 109.40 offensive efficiency (#153). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
