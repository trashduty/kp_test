### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
LIU Sharks (20-10) hosts Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (11-19) at Steinberg Wellness Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 9.5 points tells us LIU Sharks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Fairleigh Dickinson Knights** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.73 (ranked #300 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **LIU Sharks** counter with 107.36 offensive efficiency (#198). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, LIU Sharks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Fairleigh Dickinson Knights is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Jack Castleberry leads Fairleigh Dickinson Knights while Rod Strickland guides LIU Sharks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
