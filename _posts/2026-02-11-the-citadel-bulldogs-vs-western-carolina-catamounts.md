The early betting action has shaped into Western Carolina Catamounts favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Western Carolina Catamounts has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. The Citadel Bulldogs needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**The Citadel Bulldogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 102.05 (ranked #292 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Western Carolina Catamounts** counter with 106.85 offensive efficiency (#199). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
