The early betting action has shaped into Quinnipiac Bobcats favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Canisius Golden Griffins to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Quinnipiac Bobcats to play below their standard. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Canisius Golden Griffins** bring an offensive efficiency of 96.60 (ranked #343 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Quinnipiac Bobcats** counter with 106.60 offensive efficiency (#206). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
