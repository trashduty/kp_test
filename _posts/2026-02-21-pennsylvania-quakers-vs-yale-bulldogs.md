These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Yale Bulldogs has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Pennsylvania Quakers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.7% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Yale Bulldogs** counter with 122.68 offensive efficiency (#6). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 42.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
