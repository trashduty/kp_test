Boston Univ. Terriers (8-15) travels to face Holy Cross Crusaders (8-15) at Hart Center Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Boston Univ. Terriers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Boston Univ. Terriers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Boston Univ. Terriers** bring an offensive efficiency of 111.26 (ranked #115 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Holy Cross Crusaders** counter with 100.61 offensive efficiency (#306). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
