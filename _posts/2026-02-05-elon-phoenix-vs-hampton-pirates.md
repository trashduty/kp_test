These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Elon Phoenix's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
