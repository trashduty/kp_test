These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Southern Jaguars's 2.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Southern Jaguars** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.11 (ranked #264 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
