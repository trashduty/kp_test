These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Arkansas St Red Wolves has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.
