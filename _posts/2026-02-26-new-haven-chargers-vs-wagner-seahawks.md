### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
When New Haven Chargers (13-16) travels to face Wagner Seahawks (11-16) at Spiro Sports Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Wagner Seahawks favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Wagner Seahawks's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**New Haven Chargers** bring an offensive efficiency of 96.65 (ranked #348 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Wagner Seahawks** counter with 104.67 offensive efficiency (#258). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.9%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
New Haven Chargers operate at a 63.4 tempo (#363), while Wagner Seahawks play at 65.5 (#320). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 64.4) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, New Haven Chargers shoot 51.2% on two-pointers, while Wagner Seahawks convert at 46.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. New Haven Chargers's free throw rate sits at 30.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Wagner Seahawks check in at 32.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, New Haven Chargers convert 68.6% while Wagner Seahawks hit 70.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Wagner Seahawks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Ted Hotaling leads New Haven Chargers while Dwan McMillan guides Wagner Seahawks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
