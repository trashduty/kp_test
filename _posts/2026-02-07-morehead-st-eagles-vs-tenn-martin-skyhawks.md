**Morehead St Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.66 (ranked #245 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Tenn-Martin Skyhawks** counter with 105.73 offensive efficiency (#223). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 32.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
