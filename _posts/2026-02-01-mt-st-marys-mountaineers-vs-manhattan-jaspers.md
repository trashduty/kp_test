The early betting action has shaped into Mt. St. Mary's Mountaineers favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Mt. St. Mary's Mountaineers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Manhattan Jaspers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Mt. St. Mary's Mountaineers** bring an offensive efficiency of 97.38 (ranked #334 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Manhattan Jaspers** counter with 105.21 offensive efficiency (#230). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Mt. St. Mary's Mountaineers's free throw rate sits at 35.2, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Manhattan Jaspers check in at 34.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Mt. St. Mary's Mountaineers convert 67.2% while Manhattan Jaspers hit 79.6%. Manhattan Jaspers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
