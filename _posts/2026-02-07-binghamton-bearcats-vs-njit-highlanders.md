These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread

**Binghamton Bearcats** bring an offensive efficiency of 97.16 (ranked #340 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **NJIT Highlanders** counter with 98.34 offensive efficiency (#329). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
