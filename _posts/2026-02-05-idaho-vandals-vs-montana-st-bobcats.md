These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 3.5-point spread indicates Montana St Bobcats is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Idaho Vandals has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Idaho Vandals** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.25 (ranked #138 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Montana St Bobcats** counter with 110.27 offensive efficiency (#137). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
