These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Temple Owls's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 136.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**North Texas Mean Green** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.61 (ranked #301 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Temple Owls** counter with 112.48 offensive efficiency (#93). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
