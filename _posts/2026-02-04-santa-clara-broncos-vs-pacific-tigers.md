These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Santa Clara Broncos is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Pacific Tigers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Santa Clara Broncos** bring an offensive efficiency of 118.09 (ranked #42 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Pacific Tigers** counter with 110.00 offensive efficiency (#143). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
