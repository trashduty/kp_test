These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Utah Tech Trailblazers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**UT-Arlington Mavericks** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.61 (ranked #292 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.1% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Utah Tech Trailblazers** counter with 105.23 offensive efficiency (#229). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
