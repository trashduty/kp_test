These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Rhode Island Rams is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Fordham Rams has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Fordham Rams** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.17 (ranked #236 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Rhode Island Rams** counter with 108.89 offensive efficiency (#164). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
