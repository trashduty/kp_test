These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Michigan Wolverines has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Nebraska Cornhuskers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this competitive. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower

Meanwhile, **Nebraska Cornhuskers** counter with 118.37 offensive efficiency (#41). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
Michigan Wolverines operate at a 74.2 tempo (#14), while Nebraska Cornhuskers play at 68.4 (#210). Michigan Wolverines want to run, but Nebraska Cornhuskers prefer to slow things down.

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Michigan Wolverines shoot 64.3% on two-pointers, while Nebraska Cornhuskers convert at 60.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Michigan Wolverines's free throw rate sits at 41.7, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Nebraska Cornhuskers check in at 28.3, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Michigan Wolverines convert 71.8% while Nebraska Cornhuskers hit 76.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe.

#### The Betting Angle
With 10.5 points to work with, Nebraska Cornhuskers doesn't need to win—just stay competitive. 
Regarding the total of 154.5: Two offenses that can score, playing at pace? I lean over. 

The sharp play isn't always obvious. Watch for line movement, injury reports, and whether the public is hammering one side. That's where the value emerges.
