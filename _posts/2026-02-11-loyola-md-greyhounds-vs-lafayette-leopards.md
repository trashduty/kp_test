These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Lafayette Leopards's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Loyola (MD) Greyhounds** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.85 (ranked #242 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Lafayette Leopards** counter with 101.49 offensive efficiency (#305). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
