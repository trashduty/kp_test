These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Iowa Hawkeyes has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. USC Trojans needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**USC Trojans** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.69 (ranked #128 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 32.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.

Iowa Hawkeyes's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes.
