### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Liberty Flames (17-3) travels to face Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders (11-8) at Murphy Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Liberty Flames favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 136.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Liberty Flames's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 136.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Liberty Flames** bring an offensive efficiency of 116.75 (ranked #55 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.9% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders** counter with 105.14 offensive efficiency (#231). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
Liberty Flames operate at a 64.9 tempo (#339), while Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders play at 66.3 (#301). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 

#### The Interior Battle

Getting to the line matters too. Liberty Flames's free throw rate sits at 30.1, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders check in at 28.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Liberty Flames convert 69.8% while Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders hit 68.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
