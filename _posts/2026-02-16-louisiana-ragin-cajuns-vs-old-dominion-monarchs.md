These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.0-point spread indicates Old Dominion Monarchs is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns** bring an offensive efficiency of 98.88 (ranked #330 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Old Dominion Monarchs** counter with 104.91 offensive efficiency (#247). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
