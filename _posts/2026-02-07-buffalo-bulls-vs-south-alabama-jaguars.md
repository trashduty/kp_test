These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Buffalo Bulls** bring an offensive efficiency of 116.08 (ranked #62 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat.

Buffalo Bulls's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles

From a coaching perspective, George Halcovage leads Buffalo Bulls while Richie Riley guides South Alabama Jaguars. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
