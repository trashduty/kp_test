The early betting action has shaped into Tenn-Martin Skyhawks favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 125.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Tenn-Martin Skyhawks's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 125.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Tenn-Martin Skyhawks** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.15 (ranked #237 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **SIU-Edwardsville Cougars** counter with 103.06 offensive efficiency (#276). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
