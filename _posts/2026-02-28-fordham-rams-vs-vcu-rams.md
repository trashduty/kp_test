These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Fordham Rams to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires VCU Rams to play below their standard.

**Fordham Rams** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.50 (ranked #263 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **VCU Rams** counter with 118.59 offensive efficiency (#33). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.3%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
