The 6.5-point spread indicates Jacksonville Dolphins is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. North Florida Ospreys has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

**North Florida Ospreys** bring an offensive efficiency of 107.77 (ranked #184 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.4% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Jacksonville Dolphins** counter with 102.37 offensive efficiency (#288). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
