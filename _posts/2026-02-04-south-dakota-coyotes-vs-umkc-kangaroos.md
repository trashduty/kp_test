The early betting action has shaped into South Dakota Coyotes favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 157.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. South Dakota Coyotes's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 157.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**South Dakota Coyotes** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.02 (ranked #167 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **UMKC Kangaroos** counter with 94.99 offensive efficiency (#348). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. South Dakota Coyotes's free throw rate sits at 44.7, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact.
