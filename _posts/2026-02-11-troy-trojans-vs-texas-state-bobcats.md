These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Troy Trojans is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Texas State Bobcats has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Troy Trojans** bring an offensive efficiency of 112.38 (ranked #94 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Texas State Bobcats** counter with 103.14 offensive efficiency (#271). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
