These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 3.5-point spread indicates Liberty Flames is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Jacksonville St Gamecocks has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Liberty Flames** bring an offensive efficiency of 116.38 (ranked #54 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.4% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Jacksonville St Gamecocks** counter with 105.96 offensive efficiency (#226). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Liberty Flames's free throw rate sits at 32.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls.
