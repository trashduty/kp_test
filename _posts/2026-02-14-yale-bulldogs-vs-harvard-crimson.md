These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.0-point spread indicates Yale Bulldogs is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Harvard Crimson has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Yale Bulldogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 123.01 (ranked #4 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 41.9% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Harvard Crimson** counter with 109.05 offensive efficiency (#162). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.9%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
