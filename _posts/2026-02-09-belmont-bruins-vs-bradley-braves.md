These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Belmont Bruins's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Belmont Bruins** bring an offensive efficiency of 118.04 (ranked #40 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 41.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Bradley Braves** counter with 109.24 offensive efficiency (#157). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
