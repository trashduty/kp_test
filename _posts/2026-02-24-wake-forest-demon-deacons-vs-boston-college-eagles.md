The early betting action has shaped into Wake Forest Demon Deacons favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.5-point spread indicates Wake Forest Demon Deacons is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Wake Forest Demon Deacons** bring an offensive efficiency of 111.87 (ranked #102 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Boston College Eagles** counter with 100.42 offensive efficiency (#317). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. Wake Forest Demon Deacons's free throw rate sits at 34.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Boston College Eagles check in at 32.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wake Forest Demon Deacons convert 76.5% while Boston College Eagles hit 64.3%. Wake Forest Demon Deacons's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game.
