#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Central Arkansas Bears's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.
