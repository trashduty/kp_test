These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Grand Canyon Antelopes has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Wyoming Cowboys needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Wyoming Cowboys** bring an offensive efficiency of 113.37 (ranked #84 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Grand Canyon Antelopes** counter with 108.36 offensive efficiency (#178). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
