### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Boston Univ. Terriers (11-15) hosts Bucknell Bison (8-18) at Case Gym in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Boston Univ. Terriers favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 141.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Boston Univ. Terriers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Bucknell Bison has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Bucknell Bison** bring an offensive efficiency of 98.72 (ranked #330 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Boston Univ. Terriers** counter with 112.79 offensive efficiency (#87). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Getting to the line matters too. Bucknell Bison's free throw rate sits at 31.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Boston Univ. Terriers check in at 33.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Bucknell Bison convert 77.5% while Boston Univ. Terriers hit 71.5%. Bucknell Bison's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
