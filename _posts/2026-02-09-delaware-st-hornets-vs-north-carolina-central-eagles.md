These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us North Carolina Central Eagles has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Delaware St Hornets needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 134.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions.
