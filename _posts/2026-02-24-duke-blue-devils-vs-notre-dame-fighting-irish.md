The early betting action has shaped into Duke Blue Devils favored by 17.5 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 17.5-point spread screams mismatch.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Duke Blue Devils** bring an offensive efficiency of 121.69 (ranked #12 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 34.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Notre Dame Fighting Irish** counter with 110.08 offensive efficiency (#141). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
