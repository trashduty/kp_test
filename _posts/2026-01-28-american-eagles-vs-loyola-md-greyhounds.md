The early betting action has shaped into American Eagles favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 149.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.5-point spread indicates American Eagles is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 149.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**American Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 107.32 (ranked #191 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Loyola (MD) Greyhounds** counter with 104.68 offensive efficiency (#238). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. American Eagles's free throw rate sits at 28.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds check in at 32.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, American Eagles convert 77.4% while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds hit 69.0%. American Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
