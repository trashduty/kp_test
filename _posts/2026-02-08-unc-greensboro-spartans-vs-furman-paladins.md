### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Furman Paladins (16-8) hosts UNC Greensboro Spartans (9-15) at Timmons Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Furman Paladins favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at 150.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking UNC Greensboro Spartans to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Furman Paladins to play below their standard. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**UNC Greensboro Spartans** bring an offensive efficiency of 107.84 (ranked #182 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Furman Paladins** counter with 110.63 offensive efficiency (#126). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
UNC Greensboro Spartans operate at a 68.5 tempo (#197), while Furman Paladins play at 67.1 (#253). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
