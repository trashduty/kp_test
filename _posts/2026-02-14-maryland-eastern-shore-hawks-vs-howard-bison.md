### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Howard Bison has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 129.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks** bring an offensive efficiency of 93.89 (ranked #357 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Howard Bison** counter with 103.05 offensive efficiency (#277). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
