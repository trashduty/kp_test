These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates UT Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Lamar Cardinals has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Lamar Cardinals** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.74 (ranked #226 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **UT Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros** counter with 107.78 offensive efficiency (#185). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 36.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
