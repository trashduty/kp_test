#### Offensive Firepower
**Northwestern St Demons** bring an offensive efficiency of 102.20 (ranked #294 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Texas A&M-CC Islanders** counter with 100.73 offensive efficiency (#310). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
