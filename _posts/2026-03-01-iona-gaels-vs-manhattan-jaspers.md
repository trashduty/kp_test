These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Iona Gaels's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Iona Gaels** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.30 (ranked #220 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Manhattan Jaspers** counter with 106.41 offensive efficiency (#219). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
