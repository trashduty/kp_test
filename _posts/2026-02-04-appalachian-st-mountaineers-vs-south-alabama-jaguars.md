#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.5-point spread indicates Appalachian St Mountaineers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. South Alabama Jaguars has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 128.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions.
