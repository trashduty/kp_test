These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Columbia Lions is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Dartmouth Big Green has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

**Dartmouth Big Green** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.85 (ranked #227 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Columbia Lions** counter with 111.79 offensive efficiency (#104). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
