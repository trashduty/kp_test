#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.5-point spread indicates Northern Iowa Panthers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Indiana St Sycamores has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Northern Iowa Panthers** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.45 (ranked #232 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Indiana St Sycamores** counter with 104.52 offensive efficiency (#257). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
