These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking UTSA Roadrunners to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Florida Atlantic Owls to play below their standard.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Florida Atlantic Owls** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.20 (ranked #135 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **UTSA Roadrunners** counter with 96.33 offensive efficiency (#348). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
