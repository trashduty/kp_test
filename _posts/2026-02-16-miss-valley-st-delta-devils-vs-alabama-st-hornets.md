**Miss Valley St Delta Devils** bring an offensive efficiency of 89.77 (ranked #364 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Alabama St Hornets** counter with 99.39 offensive efficiency (#324). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
