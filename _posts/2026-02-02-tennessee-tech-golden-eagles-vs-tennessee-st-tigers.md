These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Tennessee St Tigers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper.

The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

**Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 100.04 (ranked #313 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Tennessee St Tigers** counter with 106.33 offensive efficiency (#210). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
