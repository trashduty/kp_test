These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Iona Gaels's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

**Saint Peter's Peacocks** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.30 (ranked #220 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack.
