These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread

The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Pacific Tigers** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.02 (ranked #161 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Pepperdine Waves** counter with 97.64 offensive efficiency (#338). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.8%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
