### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
SIU-Edwardsville Cougars (15-9) travels to face Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans (9-15) at Stephens Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 131.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 131.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**SIU-Edwardsville Cougars** bring an offensive efficiency of 102.49 (ranked #279 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans** counter with 101.25 offensive efficiency (#302). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. SIU-Edwardsville Cougars's free throw rate sits at 32.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans check in at 28.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, SIU-Edwardsville Cougars convert 67.4% while Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans hit 68.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
