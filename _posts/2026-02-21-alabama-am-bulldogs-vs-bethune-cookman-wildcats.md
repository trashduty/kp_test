#### Setting the Stage
Bethune-Cookman Wildcats (14-13) hosts Alabama A&M Bulldogs (16-11) at Moore Gym in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Bethune-Cookman Wildcats is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Alabama A&M Bulldogs has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Alabama A&M Bulldogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 103.78 (ranked #274 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Bethune-Cookman Wildcats** counter with 102.95 offensive efficiency (#283). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
