The early betting action has shaped into Alcorn St Braves favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Alcorn St Braves's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Florida A&M Rattlers** bring an offensive efficiency of 96.63 (ranked #342 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Alcorn St Braves** counter with 96.24 offensive efficiency (#348). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Florida A&M Rattlers's free throw rate sits at 38.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact.
