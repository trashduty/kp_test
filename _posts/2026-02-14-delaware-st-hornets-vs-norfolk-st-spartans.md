These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Norfolk St Spartans has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Delaware St Hornets needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

**Delaware St Hornets** bring an offensive efficiency of 88.05 (ranked #365 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Norfolk St Spartans** counter with 99.49 offensive efficiency (#320). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
