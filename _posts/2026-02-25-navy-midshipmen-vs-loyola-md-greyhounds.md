Navy Midshipmen (23-6) enters hostile territory as they take on Loyola (MD) Greyhounds (11-18) at Reitz Arena in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Navy Midshipmen has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Navy Midshipmen** bring an offensive efficiency of 111.06 (ranked #115 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
