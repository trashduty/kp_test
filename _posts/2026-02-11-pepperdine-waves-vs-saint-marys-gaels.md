### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Saint Mary's Gaels (21-4) hosts Pepperdine Waves (6-19) at University Credit Union Pavilion in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Saint Mary's Gaels favored by 24.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 24.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Pepperdine Waves to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Saint Mary's Gaels to play below their standard. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Pepperdine Waves** bring an offensive efficiency of 96.93 (ranked #343 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.1% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Saint Mary's Gaels** counter with 117.06 offensive efficiency (#51). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.7%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Pepperdine Waves operate at a 68.9 tempo (#180), while Saint Mary's Gaels play at 66.5 (#284). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 

#### The Interior Battle

Saint Mary's Gaels check in at 38.3, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Pepperdine Waves convert 77.1% while Saint Mary's Gaels hit 82.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles

From a coaching perspective, Ed Schilling leads Pepperdine Waves while Randy Bennett guides Saint Mary's Gaels. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
