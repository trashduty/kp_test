These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Grand Canyon Antelopes's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 149.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**New Mexico Lobos** bring an offensive efficiency of 114.24 (ranked #77 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Grand Canyon Antelopes** counter with 107.69 offensive efficiency (#184). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
