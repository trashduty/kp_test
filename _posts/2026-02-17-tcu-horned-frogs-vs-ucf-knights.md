The early betting action has shaped into UCF Knights favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 153.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. UCF Knights's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**TCU Horned Frogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.77 (ranked #120 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **UCF Knights** counter with 115.16 offensive efficiency (#67). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
