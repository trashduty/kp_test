### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Southern Miss Golden Eagles's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 137.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**South Alabama Jaguars** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.50 (ranked #209 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Southern Miss Golden Eagles** counter with 104.04 offensive efficiency (#258). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 27.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
