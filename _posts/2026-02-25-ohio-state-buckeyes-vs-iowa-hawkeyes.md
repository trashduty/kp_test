These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Iowa Hawkeyes is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Ohio State Buckeyes has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower

Meanwhile, **Iowa Hawkeyes** counter with 119.21 offensive efficiency (#27). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Ohio State Buckeyes's free throw rate sits at 36.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
