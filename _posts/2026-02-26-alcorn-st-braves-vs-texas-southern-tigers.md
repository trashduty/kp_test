The early betting action has shaped into Texas Southern Tigers favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Texas Southern Tigers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Alcorn St Braves needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Alcorn St Braves** bring an offensive efficiency of 97.48 (ranked #344 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Texas Southern Tigers** counter with 102.78 offensive efficiency (#289). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
