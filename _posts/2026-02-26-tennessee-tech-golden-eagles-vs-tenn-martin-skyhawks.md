These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Tenn-Martin Skyhawks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 135.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.06 (ranked #271 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Tenn-Martin Skyhawks** counter with 104.67 offensive efficiency (#259). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
