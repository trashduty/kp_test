A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. New Mexico Lobos's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

#### Offensive Firepower
**San Diego St Aztecs** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.51 (ranked #155 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
