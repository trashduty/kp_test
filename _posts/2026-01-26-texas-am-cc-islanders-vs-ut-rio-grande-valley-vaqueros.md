Defensively, Texas A&M-CC Islanders (#69 defensive efficiency) should have success against UT Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros's weaker defense (#124). 

#### The Betting Angle
Small spreads like 3.5 create interesting dynamics. I'm looking at whether Texas A&M-CC Islanders can actually separate, or if this stays inside one possession. 
Regarding the total of nan: The total seems fairly priced. I'd need to see where sharp money moves it. 

The sharp play isn't always obvious. Watch for line movement, injury reports, and whether the public is hammering one side. That's where the value emerges.
