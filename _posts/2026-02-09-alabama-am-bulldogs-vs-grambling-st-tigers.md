These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.5-point spread indicates Grambling St Tigers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Alabama A&M Bulldogs has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.
