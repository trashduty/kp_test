These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.0-point spread indicates San Francisco Dons is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Pacific Tigers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Pacific Tigers** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.48 (ranked #152 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **San Francisco Dons** counter with 110.58 offensive efficiency (#127). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
