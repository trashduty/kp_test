The early betting action has shaped into Miami Hurricanes favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 160.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Miami Hurricanes's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 160.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Miami Hurricanes** bring an offensive efficiency of 118.35 (ranked #35 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 33.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Florida St Seminoles** counter with 110.48 offensive efficiency (#128). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 32.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
