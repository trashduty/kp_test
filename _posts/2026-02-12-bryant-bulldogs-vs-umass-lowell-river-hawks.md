These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates UMass Lowell River Hawks is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Bryant Bulldogs has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Bryant Bulldogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 94.85 (ranked #351 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **UMass Lowell River Hawks** counter with 101.51 offensive efficiency (#303). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Bryant Bulldogs's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
