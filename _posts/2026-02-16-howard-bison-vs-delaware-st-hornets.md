### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Howard Bison (16-10) enters hostile territory as they take on Delaware St Hornets (6-18) at Memorial Hall in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Howard Bison favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 132.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Howard Bison has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Delaware St Hornets needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 132.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Howard Bison** bring an offensive efficiency of 103.94 (ranked #268 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Delaware St Hornets** counter with 88.26 offensive efficiency (#365). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
Howard Bison operate at a 68.8 tempo (#172), while Delaware St Hornets play at 66.6 (#272). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Howard Bison shoot 47.7% on two-pointers, while Delaware St Hornets convert at 41.8%. Howard Bison has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Howard Bison's free throw rate sits at 41.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Delaware St Hornets check in at 35.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Howard Bison convert 74.0% while Delaware St Hornets hit 69.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Delaware St Hornets get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Howard Bison. 
From a coaching perspective, Kenny Blakeney leads Howard Bison while Stan Waterman guides Delaware St Hornets. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
