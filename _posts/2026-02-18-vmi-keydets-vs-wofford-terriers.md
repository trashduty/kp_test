These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 14.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking VMI Keydets to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Wofford Terriers to play below their standard.

#### Offensive Firepower
**VMI Keydets** bring an offensive efficiency of 100.40 (ranked #315 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Wofford Terriers** counter with 114.08 offensive efficiency (#74). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
