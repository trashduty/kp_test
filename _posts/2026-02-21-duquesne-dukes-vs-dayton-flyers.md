These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Dayton Flyers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Duquesne Dukes has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

Meanwhile, **Dayton Flyers** counter with 109.34 offensive efficiency (#157). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
