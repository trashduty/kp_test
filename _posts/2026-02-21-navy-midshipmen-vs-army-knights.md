### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Navy Midshipmen (22-6) enters hostile territory as they take on Army Knights (11-17) at Christl Arena in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Navy Midshipmen has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Army Knights needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Navy Midshipmen** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.46 (ranked #131 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Army Knights** counter with 104.03 offensive efficiency (#268). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
