These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Tulane Green Wave's 0.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Temple Owls** bring an offensive efficiency of 113.17 (ranked #84 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
