### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage

The early betting action has shaped into UConn Huskies favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 11.5 points tells us UConn Huskies has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Butler Bulldogs needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**UConn Huskies** bring an offensive efficiency of 116.98 (ranked #53 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.8% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Butler Bulldogs** counter with 112.44 offensive efficiency (#93). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. UConn Huskies's free throw rate sits at 31.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls.
