### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
When Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (7-15) travels to face Wagner Seahawks (6-13) at Spiro Sports Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Fairleigh Dickinson Knights favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Fairleigh Dickinson Knights** bring an offensive efficiency of 99.70 (ranked #317 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Wagner Seahawks** counter with 105.48 offensive efficiency (#223). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
Fairleigh Dickinson Knights operate at a 65.9 tempo (#313), while Wagner Seahawks play at 65.3 (#332). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights shoot 47.3% on two-pointers, while Wagner Seahawks convert at 47.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights's free throw rate sits at 32.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Wagner Seahawks check in at 30.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights convert 70.3% while Wagner Seahawks hit 69.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Wagner Seahawks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Jack Castleberry leads Fairleigh Dickinson Knights while Dwan McMillan guides Wagner Seahawks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
