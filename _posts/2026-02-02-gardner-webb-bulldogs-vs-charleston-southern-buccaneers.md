These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 17.5-point spread screams mismatch.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Gardner-Webb Bulldogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 90.85 (ranked #363 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Charleston Southern Buccaneers** counter with 106.86 offensive efficiency (#200). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
