Hofstra Pride (16-9) travels to face Charleston Cougars (16-9) at TD Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Charleston Cougars's 0.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.
