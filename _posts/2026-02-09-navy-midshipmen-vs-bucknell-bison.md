These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Navy Midshipmen is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Bucknell Bison has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 134.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions.
