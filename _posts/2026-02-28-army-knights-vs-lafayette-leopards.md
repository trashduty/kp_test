These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 3.5-point spread indicates Lafayette Leopards is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Army Knights has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Army Knights** bring an offensive efficiency of 103.72 (ranked #276 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Lafayette Leopards** counter with 102.10 offensive efficiency (#297). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. Army Knights's free throw rate sits at 27.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Lafayette Leopards check in at 31.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Army Knights convert 71.3% while Lafayette Leopards hit 67.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Lafayette Leopards get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor.
