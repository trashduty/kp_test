These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Towson Tigers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Stony Brook Seawolves has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

**Stony Brook Seawolves** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.39 (ranked #234 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Towson Tigers** counter with 102.67 offensive efficiency (#285). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 27.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
