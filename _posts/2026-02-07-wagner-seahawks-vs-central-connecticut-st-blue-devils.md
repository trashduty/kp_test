These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Central Connecticut St Blue Devils is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Wagner Seahawks has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 136.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Wagner Seahawks** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.24 (ranked #216 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Central Connecticut St Blue Devils** counter with 107.26 offensive efficiency (#191). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Wagner Seahawks's free throw rate sits at 31.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls.

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
