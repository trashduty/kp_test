These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Toledo Rockets has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Ball State Cardinals needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Ball State Cardinals** bring an offensive efficiency of 100.12 (ranked #311 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.8% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Toledo Rockets** counter with 113.50 offensive efficiency (#86). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
