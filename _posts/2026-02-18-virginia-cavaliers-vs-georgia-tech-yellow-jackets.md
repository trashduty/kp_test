The early betting action has shaped into Virginia Cavaliers favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 146.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Virginia Cavaliers to play below their standard. The total of 146.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Virginia Cavaliers** bring an offensive efficiency of 120.27 (ranked #21 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets** counter with 103.63 offensive efficiency (#270). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.7%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

The moderate pace (around 69.0) should create a standard flow. 

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Virginia Cavaliers shoot 55.5% on two-pointers, while Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets convert at 48.4%. Virginia Cavaliers has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Virginia Cavaliers's free throw rate sits at 35.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact.
