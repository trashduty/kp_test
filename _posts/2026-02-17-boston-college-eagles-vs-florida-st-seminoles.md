The early betting action has shaped into Florida St Seminoles favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Florida St Seminoles has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Boston College Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Boston College Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 99.88 (ranked #319 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Florida St Seminoles** counter with 109.85 offensive efficiency (#144). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Florida St Seminoles's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
