The early betting action has shaped into Chattanooga Mocs favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 150.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Chattanooga Mocs's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Wofford Terriers** bring an offensive efficiency of 113.19 (ranked #92 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Chattanooga Mocs** counter with 107.32 offensive efficiency (#189). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

#### The Interior Battle

Getting to the line matters too. Wofford Terriers's free throw rate sits at 37.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact.

Chattanooga Mocs's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
