These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Manhattan Jaspers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Manhattan Jaspers** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.41 (ranked #216 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Canisius Golden Griffins** counter with 96.07 offensive efficiency (#348). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
