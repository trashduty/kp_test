### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
When Stonehill Skyhawks (9-14) travels to face Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (7-16) at Bogota Savings Bank Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 127.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Stonehill Skyhawks** bring an offensive efficiency of 93.31 (ranked #357 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 32.0% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Fairleigh Dickinson Knights** counter with 99.96 offensive efficiency (#315). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. Stonehill Skyhawks's free throw rate sits at 25.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls.
