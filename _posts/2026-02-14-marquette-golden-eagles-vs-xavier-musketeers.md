The early betting action has shaped into Xavier Musketeers favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 155.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Xavier Musketeers's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 155.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Marquette Golden Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.90 (ranked #225 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Xavier Musketeers** counter with 106.55 offensive efficiency (#210). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
