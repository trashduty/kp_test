These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Bethune-Cookman Wildcats has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Texas Southern Tigers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Texas Southern Tigers** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.55 (ranked #303 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Bethune-Cookman Wildcats** counter with 102.63 offensive efficiency (#279). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
