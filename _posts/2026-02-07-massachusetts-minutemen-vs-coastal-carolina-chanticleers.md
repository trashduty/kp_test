Massachusetts Minutemen (15-9) travels to face Coastal Carolina Chanticleers (14-11) at HTC Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Massachusetts Minutemen favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Massachusetts Minutemen's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Massachusetts Minutemen** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.00 (ranked #143 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Coastal Carolina Chanticleers** counter with 101.76 offensive efficiency (#295). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Massachusetts Minutemen's free throw rate sits at 39.2, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers check in at 31.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Massachusetts Minutemen convert 68.2% while Coastal Carolina Chanticleers hit 72.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Coastal Carolina Chanticleers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Massachusetts Minutemen. 
From a coaching perspective, Frank Martin leads Massachusetts Minutemen while Justin Gray guides Coastal Carolina Chanticleers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
