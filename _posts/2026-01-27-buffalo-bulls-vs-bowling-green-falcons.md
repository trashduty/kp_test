These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 8.0 points tells us Bowling Green Falcons has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Buffalo Bulls needs to punch above their weight class to keep this competitive.

**Buffalo Bulls** bring an offensive efficiency of 115.80 (ranked #64 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.9% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Bowling Green Falcons** counter with 111.72 offensive efficiency (#114). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
