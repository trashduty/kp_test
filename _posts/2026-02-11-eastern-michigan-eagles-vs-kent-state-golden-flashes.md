These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Kent State Golden Flashes has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Eastern Michigan Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Eastern Michigan Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.73 (ranked #299 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Kent State Golden Flashes** counter with 111.49 offensive efficiency (#108). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
