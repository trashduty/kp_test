These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Marquette Golden Eagles's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 157.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

**Butler Bulldogs** bring an offensive efficiency of 113.76 (ranked #81 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Marquette Golden Eagles** counter with 105.97 offensive efficiency (#221). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
