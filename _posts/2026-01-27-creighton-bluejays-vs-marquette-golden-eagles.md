The early betting action has shaped into Creighton Bluejays favored by 2.0 points, with the total sitting at 155.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Creighton Bluejays's 2.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent disparity. The total of 155.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Creighton Bluejays** bring an offensive efficiency of 114.40 (ranked #78 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Marquette Golden Eagles** counter with 105.23 offensive efficiency (#228). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style

#### The Interior Battle

Getting to the line matters too. Creighton Bluejays's free throw rate sits at 27.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Marquette Golden Eagles check in at 34.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Creighton Bluejays convert 75.5% while Marquette Golden Eagles hit 67.8%. Creighton Bluejays's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
