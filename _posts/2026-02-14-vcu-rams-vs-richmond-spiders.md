These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us VCU Rams has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Richmond Spiders needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 156.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.
