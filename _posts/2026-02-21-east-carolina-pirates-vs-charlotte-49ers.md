### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Charlotte 49ers (13-13) hosts East Carolina Pirates (9-17) at Halton Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread

#### Offensive Firepower
**East Carolina Pirates** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.53 (ranked #302 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Charlotte 49ers** counter with 112.01 offensive efficiency (#101). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.3%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
