#### Setting the Stage
Wichita St Shockers (16-10) enters hostile territory as they take on East Carolina Pirates (9-16) at Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Wichita St Shockers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. East Carolina Pirates needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.
