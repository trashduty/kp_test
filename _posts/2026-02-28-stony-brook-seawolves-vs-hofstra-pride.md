These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Stony Brook Seawolves to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Hofstra Pride to play below their standard.

**Stony Brook Seawolves** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.21 (ranked #248 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
