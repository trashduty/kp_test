The early betting action has shaped into George Mason Patriots favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 137.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. George Mason Patriots's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 137.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**George Mason Patriots** bring an offensive efficiency of 112.54 (ranked #92 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Saint Joseph's Hawks** counter with 104.30 offensive efficiency (#266). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
