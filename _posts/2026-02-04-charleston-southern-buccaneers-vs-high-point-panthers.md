### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
High Point Panthers (20-4) hosts Charleston Southern Buccaneers (11-12) at Qubein Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into High Point Panthers favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 163.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Charleston Southern Buccaneers to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires High Point Panthers to play below their standard. The total of 163.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Charleston Southern Buccaneers** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.86 (ranked #202 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **High Point Panthers** counter with 122.48 offensive efficiency (#8). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 34.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Charleston Southern Buccaneers operate at a 73.6 tempo (#15), while High Point Panthers play at 70.1 (#114). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.9) should create a standard flow. 

#### The Interior Battle

High Point Panthers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
