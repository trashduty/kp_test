These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Eastern Illinois Panthers** bring an offensive efficiency of 94.18 (ranked #355 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles** counter with 104.19 offensive efficiency (#253). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
