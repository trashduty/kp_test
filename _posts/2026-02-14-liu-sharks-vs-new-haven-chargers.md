### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
LIU Sharks (17-8) enters hostile territory as they take on New Haven Chargers (10-15) at The Hazell Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into LIU Sharks favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us LIU Sharks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. New Haven Chargers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**LIU Sharks** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.30 (ranked #218 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **New Haven Chargers** counter with 94.82 offensive efficiency (#351). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
