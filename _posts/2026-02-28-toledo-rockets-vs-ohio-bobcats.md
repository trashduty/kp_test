These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Ohio Bobcats's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 158.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.
