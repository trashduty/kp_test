These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Lehigh Mountain Hawks** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.68 (ranked #291 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
