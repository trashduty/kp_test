These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Louisville Cardinals's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 161.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

**Louisville Cardinals** bring an offensive efficiency of 120.34 (ranked #20 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways.

Meanwhile, **North Carolina Tar Heels** counter with 116.62 offensive efficiency (#52). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
