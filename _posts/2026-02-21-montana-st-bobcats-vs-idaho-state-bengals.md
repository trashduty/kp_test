### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown

The early betting action has shaped into Montana St Bobcats favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Montana St Bobcats's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Montana St Bobcats** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.33 (ranked #135 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Idaho State Bengals** counter with 109.52 offensive efficiency (#150). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
