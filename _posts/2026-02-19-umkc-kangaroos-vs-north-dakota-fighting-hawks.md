These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 11.0 points tells us North Dakota Fighting Hawks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UMKC Kangaroos needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**UMKC Kangaroos** bring an offensive efficiency of 94.48 (ranked #356 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **North Dakota Fighting Hawks** counter with 106.48 offensive efficiency (#212). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
