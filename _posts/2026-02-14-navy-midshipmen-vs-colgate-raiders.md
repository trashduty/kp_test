The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Navy Midshipmen's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Navy Midshipmen** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.12 (ranked #135 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Colgate Raiders** counter with 109.75 offensive efficiency (#149). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
