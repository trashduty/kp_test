### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
When Manhattan Jaspers (10-16) travels to face Niagara Purple Eagles (6-18) at Gallagher Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Niagara Purple Eagles favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Niagara Purple Eagles's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Manhattan Jaspers** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.87 (ranked #226 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Niagara Purple Eagles** counter with 98.38 offensive efficiency (#331). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
Manhattan Jaspers operate at a 68.6 tempo (#189), while Niagara Purple Eagles play at 63.2 (#365). Manhattan Jaspers want to run, but Niagara Purple Eagles prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 65.9) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Manhattan Jaspers shoot 47.9% on two-pointers, while Niagara Purple Eagles convert at 49.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Manhattan Jaspers's free throw rate sits at 34.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Niagara Purple Eagles check in at 24.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Manhattan Jaspers convert 80.2% while Niagara Purple Eagles hit 70.2%. Manhattan Jaspers's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
