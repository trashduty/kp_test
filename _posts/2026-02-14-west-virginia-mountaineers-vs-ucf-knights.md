These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 3.5-point spread indicates UCF Knights is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. West Virginia Mountaineers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**West Virginia Mountaineers** bring an offensive efficiency of 108.36 (ranked #174 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **UCF Knights** counter with 115.87 offensive efficiency (#64). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.3%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

UCF Knights's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
