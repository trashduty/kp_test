These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread

#### Offensive Firepower
**UConn Huskies** bring an offensive efficiency of 115.48 (ranked #67 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
