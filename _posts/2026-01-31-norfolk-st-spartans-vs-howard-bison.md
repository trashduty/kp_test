These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Howard Bison is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Norfolk St Spartans has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Norfolk St Spartans** bring an offensive efficiency of 99.95 (ranked #313 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Howard Bison** counter with 99.78 offensive efficiency (#315). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
