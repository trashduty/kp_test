These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.5-point spread indicates Marist Red Foxes is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Manhattan Jaspers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

**Manhattan Jaspers** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.41 (ranked #216 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Marist Red Foxes** counter with 103.39 offensive efficiency (#277). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
