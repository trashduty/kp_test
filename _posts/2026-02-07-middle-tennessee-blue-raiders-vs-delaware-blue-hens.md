These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 4.0-point spread indicates Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Delaware Blue Hens has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 130.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.28 (ranked #250 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
