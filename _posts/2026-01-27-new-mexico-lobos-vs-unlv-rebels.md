The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower

#### The Betting Angle
The 5.5-point spread asks: can UNLV Rebels keep it within striking distance? 
Regarding the total of 156.5: The number seems inflated relative to the offensive profiles. Under could be the move.
