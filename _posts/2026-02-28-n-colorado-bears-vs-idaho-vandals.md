The early betting action has shaped into Idaho Vandals favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 152.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Idaho Vandals's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**N Colorado Bears** bring an offensive efficiency of 113.26 (ranked #84 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Idaho Vandals** counter with 110.46 offensive efficiency (#126). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
