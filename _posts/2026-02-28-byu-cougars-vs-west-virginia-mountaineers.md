The early betting action has shaped into BYU Cougars favored by 2.0 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. BYU Cougars's 2.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**BYU Cougars** bring an offensive efficiency of 119.74 (ranked #23 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **West Virginia Mountaineers** counter with 107.38 offensive efficiency (#197). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, BYU Cougars shoot 56.6% on two-pointers, while West Virginia Mountaineers convert at 52.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency.

BYU Cougars's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game.
