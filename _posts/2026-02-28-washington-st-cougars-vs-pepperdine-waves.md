These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Washington St Cougars has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Pepperdine Waves needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 157.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

**Washington St Cougars** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.22 (ranked #132 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Pepperdine Waves** counter with 99.69 offensive efficiency (#329). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
