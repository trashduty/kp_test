These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking CSU Bakersfield Roadrunners to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors to play below their standard.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors** bring an offensive efficiency of 108.96 (ranked #162 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **CSU Bakersfield Roadrunners** counter with 98.59 offensive efficiency (#330). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
