These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Davidson Wildcats has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Loyola (Chi) Ramblers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Loyola (Chi) Ramblers** bring an offensive efficiency of 102.28 (ranked #287 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.0% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Davidson Wildcats** counter with 109.31 offensive efficiency (#158). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.8%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Davidson Wildcats check in at 31.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Loyola (Chi) Ramblers convert 68.0% while Davidson Wildcats hit 65.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
