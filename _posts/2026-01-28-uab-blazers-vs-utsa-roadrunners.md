These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking UTSA Roadrunners to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires UAB Blazers to play below their standard. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**UAB Blazers** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.75 (ranked #125 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 28.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **UTSA Roadrunners** counter with 92.76 offensive efficiency (#358). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 27.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
