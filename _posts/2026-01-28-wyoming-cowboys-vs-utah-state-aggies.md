The early betting action has shaped into Utah State Aggies favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 151.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Wyoming Cowboys to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Utah State Aggies to play below their standard. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Wyoming Cowboys** bring an offensive efficiency of 113.48 (ranked #87 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 32.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Utah State Aggies** counter with 120.85 offensive efficiency (#20). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
