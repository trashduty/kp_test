These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

**North Alabama Lions** bring an offensive efficiency of 103.00 (ranked #270 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.0% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Central Arkansas Bears** counter with 109.73 offensive efficiency (#148). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
