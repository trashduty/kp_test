These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates South Alabama Jaguars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Southern Miss Golden Eagles has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Southern Miss Golden Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.21 (ranked #271 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **South Alabama Jaguars** counter with 109.11 offensive efficiency (#163). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Southern Miss Golden Eagles's free throw rate sits at 42.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact.

Southern Miss Golden Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
