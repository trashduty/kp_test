### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Boston Univ. Terriers (13-15) travels to face Lehigh Mountain Hawks (12-16) at Stabler Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Boston Univ. Terriers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Boston Univ. Terriers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Boston Univ. Terriers** bring an offensive efficiency of 114.58 (ranked #73 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.4% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Lehigh Mountain Hawks** counter with 102.36 offensive efficiency (#293). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

#### The Interior Battle

Getting to the line matters too. Boston Univ. Terriers's free throw rate sits at 33.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Lehigh Mountain Hawks check in at 30.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Boston Univ. Terriers convert 72.3% while Lehigh Mountain Hawks hit 72.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
