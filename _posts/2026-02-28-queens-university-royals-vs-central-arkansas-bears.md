These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Central Arkansas Bears's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 164.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Queens University Royals** bring an offensive efficiency of 120.05 (ranked #20 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Central Arkansas Bears** counter with 112.62 offensive efficiency (#93). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
