### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Merrimack Warriors (20-10) enters hostile territory as they take on Niagara Purple Eagles (8-21) at Gallagher Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Merrimack Warriors favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Merrimack Warriors has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Niagara Purple Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Merrimack Warriors** bring an offensive efficiency of 107.11 (ranked #206 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Niagara Purple Eagles** counter with 99.85 offensive efficiency (#327). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Merrimack Warriors's free throw rate sits at 40.5, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Niagara Purple Eagles check in at 26.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Merrimack Warriors convert 78.7% while Niagara Purple Eagles hit 71.3%. Merrimack Warriors's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
