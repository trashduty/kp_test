These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us LIU Sharks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Stonehill Skyhawks needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.
