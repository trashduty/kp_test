These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.0-point spread indicates Saint Joseph's Hawks is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Fordham Rams has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Fordham Rams** bring an offensive efficiency of 105.06 (ranked #236 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Saint Joseph's Hawks** counter with 104.10 offensive efficiency (#254). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
