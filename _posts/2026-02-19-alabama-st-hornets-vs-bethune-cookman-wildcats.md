These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 5.5-point spread indicates Bethune-Cookman Wildcats is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Alabama St Hornets has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Alabama St Hornets** bring an offensive efficiency of 100.51 (ranked #312 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Bethune-Cookman Wildcats** counter with 102.48 offensive efficiency (#290). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
