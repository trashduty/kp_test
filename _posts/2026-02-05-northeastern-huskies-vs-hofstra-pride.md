The early betting action has shaped into Hofstra Pride favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 155.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Hofstra Pride has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Northeastern Huskies needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 155.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Northeastern Huskies** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.34 (ranked #157 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Hofstra Pride** counter with 112.89 offensive efficiency (#89). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
