These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread

**DePaul Blue Demons** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.08 (ranked #211 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
