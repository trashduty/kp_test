These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Florida Gulf Coast Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 110.41 (ranked #128 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Stetson Hatters** counter with 104.52 offensive efficiency (#259). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
