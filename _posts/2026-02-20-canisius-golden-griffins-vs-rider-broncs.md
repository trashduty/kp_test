These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Rider Broncs's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Canisius Golden Griffins** bring an offensive efficiency of 96.23 (ranked #346 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Rider Broncs** counter with 95.58 offensive efficiency (#351). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
