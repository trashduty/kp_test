These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Penn State Nittany Lions to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Ohio State Buckeyes to play below their standard.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Ohio State Buckeyes** brings an offensive efficiency of 105.75 (ranked #220 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Penn State Nittany Lions** counters with 107.44 offensive efficiency (#186). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.5%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Defensively, both teams rank similarly on the defensive end (#255 and #217), so offense may determine the outcome. 

#### The Betting Angle
With 13.5 points to work with, Penn State Nittany Lions doesn't need to win—just stay competitive. 
Regarding the total of nan: The total seems fairly priced. I'd need to see where sharp money moves it. 

The sharp play isn't always obvious. Watch for line movement, injury reports, and whether the public is hammering one side. That's where the value emerges.
