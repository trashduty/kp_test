#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Appalachian St Mountaineers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Georgia Southern Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Georgia Southern Eagles** bring an offensive efficiency of 108.69 (ranked #173 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Appalachian St Mountaineers** counter with 107.54 offensive efficiency (#192). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Georgia Southern Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game.
