These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Kennesaw St Owls has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Delaware Blue Hens needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

#### Offensive Firepower
**Delaware Blue Hens** bring an offensive efficiency of 104.51 (ranked #261 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.6% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Kennesaw St Owls** counter with 110.20 offensive efficiency (#134). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
