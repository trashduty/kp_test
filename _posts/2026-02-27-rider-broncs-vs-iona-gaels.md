### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage

The early betting action has shaped into Iona Gaels favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Rider Broncs to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Iona Gaels to play below their standard. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Rider Broncs** bring an offensive efficiency of 95.96 (ranked #350 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Iona Gaels** counter with 106.12 offensive efficiency (#222). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
