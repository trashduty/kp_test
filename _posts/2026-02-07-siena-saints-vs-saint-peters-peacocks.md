These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Siena Saints's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Siena Saints** bring an offensive efficiency of 111.93 (ranked #104 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 31.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack.
