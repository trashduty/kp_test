These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Central Connecticut St Blue Devils's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 128.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions.

Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.3% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **New Haven Chargers** counter with 94.08 offensive efficiency (#356). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
