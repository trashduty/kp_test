These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. UNC Wilmington Seahawks's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

**Hofstra Pride** bring an offensive efficiency of 112.50 (ranked #94 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming.
