These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Providence Friars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Xavier Musketeers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 170.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Xavier Musketeers** bring an offensive efficiency of 107.91 (ranked #186 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.6% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Providence Friars** counter with 116.16 offensive efficiency (#56). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
