These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Charleston Cougars's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**UNC Wilmington Seahawks** bring an offensive efficiency of 114.11 (ranked #79 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Charleston Cougars** counter with 110.25 offensive efficiency (#134). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
