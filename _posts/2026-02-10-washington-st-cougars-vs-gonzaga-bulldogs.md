The early betting action has shaped into Gonzaga Bulldogs favored by 20.0 points, with the total sitting at 158.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 20.0-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Washington St Cougars to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Gonzaga Bulldogs to play below their standard. The total of 158.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Washington St Cougars** bring an offensive efficiency of 111.41 (ranked #110 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.9% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Gonzaga Bulldogs** counter with 121.76 offensive efficiency (#13). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
