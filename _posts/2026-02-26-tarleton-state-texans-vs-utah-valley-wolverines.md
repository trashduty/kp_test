**Tarleton State Texans** bring an offensive efficiency of 101.60 (ranked #301 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Utah Valley Wolverines** counter with 110.23 offensive efficiency (#132). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
