### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown

The early betting action has shaped into Creighton Bluejays favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Creighton Bluejays's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Seton Hall Pirates** bring an offensive efficiency of 106.95 (ranked #196 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Creighton Bluejays** counter with 111.65 offensive efficiency (#110). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
