### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Louisville Cardinals (19-7) hosts Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (11-16) at KFC Yum! Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Louisville Cardinals favored by 22.5 points, with the total sitting at 163.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 22.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Louisville Cardinals to play below their standard. The total of 163.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets** bring an offensive efficiency of 102.97 (ranked #282 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Louisville Cardinals** counter with 120.42 offensive efficiency (#18). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Louisville Cardinals's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
