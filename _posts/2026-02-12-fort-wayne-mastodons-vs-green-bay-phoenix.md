### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown
#### Setting the Stage
Green Bay Phoenix (14-12) hosts Fort Wayne Mastodons (14-11) at Resch Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Green Bay Phoenix favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Green Bay Phoenix's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

**Fort Wayne Mastodons** bring an offensive efficiency of 107.32 (ranked #192 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Green Bay Phoenix** counter with 112.67 offensive efficiency (#87). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.3%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
