These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. UNLV Rebels's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way.

**Colorado St Rams** bring an offensive efficiency of 117.12 (ranked #47 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.6% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat.
