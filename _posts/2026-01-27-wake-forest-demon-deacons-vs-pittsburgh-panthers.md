### Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown

Wake Forest Demon Deacons (11-9) travels to face Pittsburgh Panthers (8-12) at Petersen Events Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Pittsburgh Panthers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Pittsburgh Panthers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Wake Forest Demon Deacons** bring an offensive efficiency of 111.16 (ranked #121 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Pittsburgh Panthers** counter with 110.24 offensive efficiency (#131). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 

#### Tempo & Playing Style
Wake Forest Demon Deacons operate at a 71.9 tempo (#46), while Pittsburgh Panthers play at 65.7 (#323). Wake Forest Demon Deacons want to run, but Pittsburgh Panthers prefer to slow things down.

#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Wake Forest Demon Deacons shoot 53.8% on two-pointers, while Pittsburgh Panthers convert at 51.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Wake Forest Demon Deacons's free throw rate sits at 32.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Pittsburgh Panthers check in at 31.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wake Forest Demon Deacons convert 75.9% while Pittsburgh Panthers hit 66.3%. Wake Forest Demon Deacons's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
