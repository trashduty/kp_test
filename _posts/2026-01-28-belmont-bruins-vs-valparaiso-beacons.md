The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.9% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
Meanwhile, **Valparaiso Beacons** counter with 103.43 offensive efficiency (#258). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
