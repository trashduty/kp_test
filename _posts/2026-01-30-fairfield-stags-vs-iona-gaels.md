The early betting action has shaped into Iona Gaels favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 3.5-point spread indicates Iona Gaels is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Fairfield Stags has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**Fairfield Stags** bring an offensive efficiency of 109.63 (ranked #147 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
Meanwhile, **Iona Gaels** counter with 104.38 offensive efficiency (#241). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
