These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 128.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions.
