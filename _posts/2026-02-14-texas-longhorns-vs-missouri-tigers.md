These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Texas Longhorns's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

Meanwhile, **Missouri Tigers** counter with 116.40 offensive efficiency (#58). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
