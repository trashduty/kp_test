These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.

#### Breaking Down the Spread
The 6.5-point spread indicates Oral Roberts Golden Eagles is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. UMKC Kangaroos has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 146.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 

#### Offensive Firepower
**UMKC Kangaroos** bring an offensive efficiency of 94.91 (ranked #350 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
Meanwhile, **Oral Roberts Golden Eagles** counter with 99.58 offensive efficiency (#317). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. UMKC Kangaroos's free throw rate sits at 29.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Oral Roberts Golden Eagles check in at 34.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, UMKC Kangaroos convert 68.6% while Oral Roberts Golden Eagles hit 73.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 

#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Oral Roberts Golden Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor.
