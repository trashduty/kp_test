<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
LIU Sharks (17-9) hosts Wagner Seahawks (9-15) at Steinberg Wellness Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into LIU Sharks favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us LIU Sharks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Wagner Seahawks needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Wagner Seahawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.71 (ranked #253 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>LIU Sharks</strong> counter with 105.45 offensive efficiency (#233). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Wagner Seahawks operate at a 65.5 tempo (#322), while LIU Sharks play at 68.7 (#181). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Wagner Seahawks shoot 46.8% on two-pointers, while LIU Sharks convert at 51.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Wagner Seahawks's free throw rate sits at 31.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. LIU Sharks check in at 32.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wagner Seahawks convert 70.1% while LIU Sharks hit 65.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, LIU Sharks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Wagner Seahawks is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Dwan McMillan leads Wagner Seahawks while Rod Strickland guides LIU Sharks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with LIU Sharks significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Wagner Seahawks will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
Both teams are fairly evenly matched on both ends of the floor. This could come down to execution in crunch time. 
</p>

<strong>X-Factor:</strong> Wagner Seahawks can light it up from three-point range (37.2%), but LIU Sharks defend the arc exceptionally well, holding opponents to just 30.9%. This battle on the perimeter could decide the game. 

<h2>Wagner Seahawks</h2>

<p>
Wagner Seahawks comes in ranked #324 overall by KenPom. They're dangerous from beyond the arc, shooting 37.2% from three (ranked #31 nationally), so expect them to let it fly from deep. Defense has been a struggle, and they'll need to tighten things up to have a chance in this one.
