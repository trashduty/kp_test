These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Georgia Bulldogs's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 164.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Texas Longhorns</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 121.68 (ranked #14 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
