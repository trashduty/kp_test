<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Nevada Wolf Pack has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UNLV Rebels needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<strong>UNLV Rebels</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.65 (ranked #179 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Nevada Wolf Pack</strong> counter with 114.46 offensive efficiency (#76). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.6%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

</p>
