<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Albany Great Danes (7-14) hosts NJIT Highlanders (9-12) at Broadview Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Albany Great Danes favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Albany Great Danes is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. NJIT Highlanders has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>NJIT Highlanders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 95.77 (ranked #343 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Albany Great Danes</strong> counter with 102.35 offensive efficiency (#277). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.6%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders operate at a 69.1 tempo (#180), while Albany Great Danes play at 66.6 (#284). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.9) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, NJIT Highlanders shoot 44.7% on two-pointers, while Albany Great Danes convert at 52.2%. Albany Great Danes has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. NJIT Highlanders's free throw rate sits at 34.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Albany Great Danes check in at 26.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, NJIT Highlanders convert 72.1% while Albany Great Danes hit 65.3%. NJIT Highlanders's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Albany Great Danes get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—NJIT Highlanders is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Grant Billmeier leads NJIT Highlanders while Dwayne Killings guides Albany Great Danes. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, Albany Great Danes holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but NJIT Highlanders could make this interesting if they play to their potential.

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
