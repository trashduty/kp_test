<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Boston Univ. Terriers (9-15) hosts Loyola (MD) Greyhounds (9-15) at Case Gym in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Boston Univ. Terriers favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Boston Univ. Terriers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Loyola (MD) Greyhounds</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.11 (ranked #236 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Boston Univ. Terriers</strong> counter with 111.81 offensive efficiency (#109). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.7%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Loyola (MD) Greyhounds operate at a 68.6 tempo (#199), while Boston Univ. Terriers play at 63.9 (#355). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.2) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Loyola (MD) Greyhounds shoot 51.4% on two-pointers, while Boston Univ. Terriers convert at 55.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds's free throw rate sits at 31.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Boston Univ. Terriers check in at 32.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Loyola (MD) Greyhounds convert 71.1% while Boston Univ. Terriers hit 71.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Boston Univ. Terriers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Loyola (MD) Greyhounds is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Josh Loeffler leads Loyola (MD) Greyhounds while Joe Jones guides Boston Univ. Terriers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
