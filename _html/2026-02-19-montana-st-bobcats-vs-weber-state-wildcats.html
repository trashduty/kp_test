These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Weber State Wildcats's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Montana St Bobcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.41 (ranked #131 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Weber State Wildcats</strong> counter with 111.28 offensive efficiency (#114). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
