<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When Bucknell Bison (8-21) travels to face Army Knights (11-18) at Christl Arena, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Army Knights favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Army Knights's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Bucknell Bison</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 98.49 (ranked #338 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.0% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Army Knights</strong> counter with 103.82 offensive efficiency (#274). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Bucknell Bison operate at a 66.9 tempo (#256), while Army Knights play at 66.9 (#257). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.9) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Bucknell Bison shoot 49.7% on two-pointers, while Army Knights convert at 49.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Bucknell Bison's free throw rate sits at 30.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Army Knights check in at 27.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Bucknell Bison convert 77.2% while Army Knights hit 71.3%. Bucknell Bison's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Army Knights get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, John Griffin leads Bucknell Bison while Kevin Kuwik guides Army Knights. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
