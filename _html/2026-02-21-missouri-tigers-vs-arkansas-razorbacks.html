These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Arkansas Razorbacks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Missouri Tigers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 161.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Missouri Tigers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 115.96 (ranked #59 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Arkansas Razorbacks</strong> counter with 123.04 offensive efficiency (#4). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.7%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>
