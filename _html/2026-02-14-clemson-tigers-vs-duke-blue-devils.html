<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Duke Blue Devils (22-2) hosts Clemson Tigers (20-5) at Cameron Indoor Stadium in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Duke Blue Devils favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at 133.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Clemson Tigers to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Duke Blue Devils to play below their standard. The total of 133.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Clemson Tigers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.80 (ranked #76 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Duke Blue Devils</strong> counter with 121.25 offensive efficiency (#17). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 34.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Clemson Tigers operate at a 65.7 tempo (#313), while Duke Blue Devils play at 68.2 (#211). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.0) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Clemson Tigers shoot 55.3% on two-pointers, while Duke Blue Devils convert at 62.2%. Duke Blue Devils has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Clemson Tigers's free throw rate sits at 38.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Duke Blue Devils check in at 38.6, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Clemson Tigers convert 72.3% while Duke Blue Devils hit 71.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Duke Blue Devils get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Clemson Tigers is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Brad Brownell leads Clemson Tigers while Jon Scheyer guides Duke Blue Devils. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
Both teams feature strong defenses (#14 and #3), so offense may be at a premium. 
</p>
<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
