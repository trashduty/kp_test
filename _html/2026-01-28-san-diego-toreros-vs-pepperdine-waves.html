<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
San Diego Toreros (9-13) travels to face Pepperdine Waves (6-16) at Firestone Fieldhouse in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into San Diego Toreros favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. San Diego Toreros's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>San Diego Toreros</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.85 (ranked #235 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Pepperdine Waves</strong> counter with 96.63 offensive efficiency (#336). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
San Diego Toreros operate at a 70.5 tempo (#104), while Pepperdine Waves play at 68.2 (#220). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, San Diego Toreros shoot 51.6% on two-pointers, while Pepperdine Waves convert at 49.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. San Diego Toreros's free throw rate sits at 27.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Pepperdine Waves check in at 34.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, San Diego Toreros convert 75.2% while Pepperdine Waves hit 78.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Pepperdine Waves get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for San Diego Toreros. 
From a coaching perspective, Steve Lavin leads San Diego Toreros while Ed Schilling guides Pepperdine Waves. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with San Diego Toreros significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Pepperdine Waves will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
