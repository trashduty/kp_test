<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Clemson Tigers (20-7) hosts Florida St Seminoles (13-13) at Littlejohn Coliseum in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Clemson Tigers favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Clemson Tigers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Florida St Seminoles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Florida St Seminoles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.23 (ranked #136 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Clemson Tigers</strong> counter with 112.88 offensive efficiency (#90). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Florida St Seminoles operate at a 73.0 tempo (#17), while Clemson Tigers play at 65.6 (#318). Florida St Seminoles want to run, but Clemson Tigers prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The moderate pace (around 69.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Florida St Seminoles shoot 53.7% on two-pointers, while Clemson Tigers convert at 55.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Florida St Seminoles's free throw rate sits at 35.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Clemson Tigers check in at 37.4, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Florida St Seminoles convert 71.8% while Clemson Tigers hit 72.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Clemson Tigers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Florida St Seminoles is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Luke Loucks leads Florida St Seminoles while Brad Brownell guides Clemson Tigers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
