These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Alabama St Hornets's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent disparity. The total of 159.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

<strong>Alabama St Hornets</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.33 (ranked #293 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
