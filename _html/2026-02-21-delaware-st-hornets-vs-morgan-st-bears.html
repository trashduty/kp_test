These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Morgan St Bears is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Delaware St Hornets has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Delaware St Hornets</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 87.96 (ranked #365 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.0% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Morgan St Bears</strong> counter with 99.59 offensive efficiency (#326). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Delaware St Hornets's free throw rate sits at 34.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Morgan St Bears check in at 42.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Delaware St Hornets convert 68.8% while Morgan St Bears hit 73.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Morgan St Bears get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor.
