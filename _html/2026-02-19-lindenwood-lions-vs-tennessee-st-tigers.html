These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Tennessee St Tigers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Lindenwood Lions has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 163.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Lindenwood Lions</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.15 (ranked #294 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.0% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tennessee St Tigers</strong> counter with 108.92 offensive efficiency (#167). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.8%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Lindenwood Lions's free throw rate sits at 39.2, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Tennessee St Tigers check in at 33.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Lindenwood Lions convert 67.5% while Tennessee St Tigers hit 75.3%. Tennessee St Tigers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
