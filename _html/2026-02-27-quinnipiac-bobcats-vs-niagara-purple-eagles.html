<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Quinnipiac Bobcats has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Niagara Purple Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Quinnipiac Bobcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.36 (ranked #245 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Niagara Purple Eagles</strong> counter with 99.33 offensive efficiency (#332). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
