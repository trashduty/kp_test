<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>

The early betting action has shaped into South Carolina Upstate Spartans favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. South Carolina Upstate Spartans's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Longwood Lancers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.40 (ranked #208 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>South Carolina Upstate Spartans</strong> counter with 100.75 offensive efficiency (#300). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

When they do get fouled, Longwood Lancers convert 76.3% while South Carolina Upstate Spartans hit 67.9%. Longwood Lancers's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>
