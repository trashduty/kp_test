<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Arkansas St Red Wolves has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Old Dominion Monarchs needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 161.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Old Dominion Monarchs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.54 (ranked #255 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Arkansas St Red Wolves</strong> counter with 110.15 offensive efficiency (#133). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.8%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. Old Dominion Monarchs's free throw rate sits at 33.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls.
