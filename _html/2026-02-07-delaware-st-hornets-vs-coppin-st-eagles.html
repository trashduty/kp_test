These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Delaware St Hornets's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

Meanwhile, <strong>Coppin St Eagles</strong> counter with 91.76 offensive efficiency (#361). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
