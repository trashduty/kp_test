<h1>Wagner Seahawks vs LIU Sharks</h1>
<h2>Game Preview for January 26, 2026</h2>

<div class="betting-lines">
  <h3>Betting Lines</h3>
  <p><strong>Spread:</strong> LIU Sharks -10.5</p>
  <p><strong>Moneyline:</strong> Wagner Seahawks (+467) | LIU Sharks (-697)</p>
  <p><strong>Total:</strong> 144.5</p>
</div>

<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<p>
#### Setting the Stage
LIU Sharks (12-8) hosts Wagner Seahawks (6-12) at Steinberg Wellness Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into LIU Sharks favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 10.5 points tells us LIU Sharks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Wagner Seahawks needs to punch above their weight class to keep this competitive. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<p>
#### Offensive Firepower
</p>
<strong>Wagner Seahawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.40 (ranked #209 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>LIU Sharks</strong> counter with 106.84 offensive efficiency (#200). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<p>
#### Tempo & Playing Style
Wagner Seahawks operate at a 65.7 tempo (#326), while LIU Sharks play at 69.4 (#159). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.5) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<p>
#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Wagner Seahawks shoot 47.7% on two-pointers, while LIU Sharks convert at 51.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Wagner Seahawks's free throw rate sits at 30.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. LIU Sharks check in at 32.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wagner Seahawks convert 69.1% while LIU Sharks hit 63.7%. Wagner Seahawks's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<p>
#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, LIU Sharks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Wagner Seahawks is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Dwan McMillan leads Wagner Seahawks while Rod Strickland guides LIU Sharks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
Defensively, LIU Sharks (#183 defensive efficiency) will look to clamp down on Wagner Seahawks (#301 defensively). 
</p>

<p>
#### The Betting Angle
With 10.5 points to work with, Wagner Seahawks doesn't need to win—just stay competitive. 
Regarding the total of 144.5: The total seems fairly priced. I'd need to see where sharp money moves it. 
</p>

<p>
The sharp play isn't always obvious. Watch for line movement, injury reports, and whether the public is hammering one side. That's where the value emerges.
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with LIU Sharks significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Wagner Seahawks will need their best performance of the season to pull off the upset. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: LIU Sharks's Offense vs Wagner Seahawks's Defense</strong>
