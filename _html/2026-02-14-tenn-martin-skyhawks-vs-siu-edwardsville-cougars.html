<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Tenn-Martin Skyhawks (19-7) travels to face SIU-Edwardsville Cougars (17-9) at First Community Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Tenn-Martin Skyhawks favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 125.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Tenn-Martin Skyhawks's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 125.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Tenn-Martin Skyhawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.15 (ranked #237 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>SIU-Edwardsville Cougars</strong> counter with 103.06 offensive efficiency (#276). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Tenn-Martin Skyhawks operate at a 66.6 tempo (#277), while SIU-Edwardsville Cougars play at 65.9 (#310). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Tenn-Martin Skyhawks shoot 53.4% on two-pointers, while SIU-Edwardsville Cougars convert at 47.4%. Tenn-Martin Skyhawks has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Tenn-Martin Skyhawks's free throw rate sits at 41.2, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. SIU-Edwardsville Cougars check in at 32.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Tenn-Martin Skyhawks convert 66.6% while SIU-Edwardsville Cougars hit 68.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, SIU-Edwardsville Cougars get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Tenn-Martin Skyhawks. 
From a coaching perspective, Jeremy Shulman leads Tenn-Martin Skyhawks while Brian Barone guides SIU-Edwardsville Cougars. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
Both teams feature strong defenses (#17 and #30), so offense may be at a premium. 
</p>
<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
