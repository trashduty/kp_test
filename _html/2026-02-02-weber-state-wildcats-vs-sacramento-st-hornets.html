The early betting action has shaped into Weber State Wildcats favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 162.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Weber State Wildcats's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 162.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Weber State Wildcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.46 (ranked #130 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.3% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Sacramento St Hornets</strong> counter with 103.39 offensive efficiency (#265). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>

Getting to the line matters too. Weber State Wildcats's free throw rate sits at 41.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Sacramento St Hornets check in at 38.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Weber State Wildcats convert 70.5% while Sacramento St Hornets hit 77.9%. Sacramento St Hornets's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>
