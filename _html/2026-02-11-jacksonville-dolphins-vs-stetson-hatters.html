<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Jacksonville Dolphins (9-16) travels to face Stetson Hatters (8-17) at Edmunds Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Jacksonville Dolphins favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 142.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Jacksonville Dolphins's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Jacksonville Dolphins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.51 (ranked #284 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Stetson Hatters</strong> counter with 102.07 offensive efficiency (#291). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Jacksonville Dolphins operate at a 65.6 tempo (#320), while Stetson Hatters play at 68.7 (#186). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Jacksonville Dolphins shoot 51.6% on two-pointers, while Stetson Hatters convert at 51.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Jacksonville Dolphins's free throw rate sits at 32.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Stetson Hatters check in at 33.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Jacksonville Dolphins convert 71.0% while Stetson Hatters hit 69.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Stetson Hatters get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Jacksonville Dolphins. 
From a coaching perspective, Jordan Mincy leads Jacksonville Dolphins while Donnie Jones guides Stetson Hatters. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
