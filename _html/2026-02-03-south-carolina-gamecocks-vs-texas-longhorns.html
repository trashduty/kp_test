<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 13.0-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking South Carolina Gamecocks to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Texas Longhorns to play below their standard.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>South Carolina Gamecocks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.90 (ranked #108 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Texas Longhorns</strong> counter with 120.69 offensive efficiency (#22). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 34.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
