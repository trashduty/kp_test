These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Robert Morris Colonials has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. IUPUI Jaguars needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>IUPUI Jaguars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.39 (ranked #188 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Robert Morris Colonials</strong> counter with 112.14 offensive efficiency (#109). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.3%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
