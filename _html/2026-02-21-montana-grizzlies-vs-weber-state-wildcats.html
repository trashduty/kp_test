These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.3% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Weber State Wildcats</strong> counter with 111.33 offensive efficiency (#111). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
