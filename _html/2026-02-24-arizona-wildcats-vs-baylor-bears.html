These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Arizona Wildcats has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Baylor Bears needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Arizona Wildcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 119.81 (ranked #25 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Baylor Bears</strong> counter with 114.80 offensive efficiency (#70). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Arizona Wildcats operate at a 72.3 tempo (#25), while Baylor Bears play at 70.3 (#95). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

</p>
