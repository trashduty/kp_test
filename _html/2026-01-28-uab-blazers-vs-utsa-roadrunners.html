<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
UAB Blazers (12-8) enters hostile territory as they take on UTSA Roadrunners (4-16) at UTSA Convocation Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into UAB Blazers favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 151.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking UTSA Roadrunners to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires UAB Blazers to play below their standard. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UAB Blazers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.75 (ranked #125 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 28.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>UTSA Roadrunners</strong> counter with 92.76 offensive efficiency (#358). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 27.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
UAB Blazers operate at a 71.5 tempo (#65), while UTSA Roadrunners play at 69.8 (#141). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.6) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, UAB Blazers shoot 50.3% on two-pointers, while UTSA Roadrunners convert at 44.6%. UAB Blazers has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. UAB Blazers's free throw rate sits at 36.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. UTSA Roadrunners check in at 30.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, UAB Blazers convert 71.9% while UTSA Roadrunners hit 69.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, UTSA Roadrunners get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for UAB Blazers. 
From a coaching perspective, Andy Kennedy leads UAB Blazers while Austin Claunch guides UTSA Roadrunners. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with UAB Blazers significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. UTSA Roadrunners will need their best performance to stay competitive.
