These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Ohio Bobcats is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Northern Illinois Huskies has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Ohio Bobcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.28 (ranked #195 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Northern Illinois Huskies</strong> counter with 97.52 offensive efficiency (#341). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Ohio Bobcats's free throw rate sits at 36.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Northern Illinois Huskies check in at 38.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Ohio Bobcats convert 70.6% while Northern Illinois Huskies hit 65.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Northern Illinois Huskies get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Ohio Bobcats.
