<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
UT-Arlington Mavericks (14-9) travels to face Abilene Christian Wildcats (10-13) at Moody Coliseum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into UT-Arlington Mavericks favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 134.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. UT-Arlington Mavericks's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 134.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UT-Arlington Mavericks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.03 (ranked #295 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Abilene Christian Wildcats</strong> counter with 98.30 offensive efficiency (#334). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
