<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Colgate Raiders (16-12) hosts Loyola (MD) Greyhounds (11-17) at Cotterell Court in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Colgate Raiders favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Colgate Raiders has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Loyola (MD) Greyhounds</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.95 (ranked #225 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Colgate Raiders</strong> counter with 109.50 offensive efficiency (#151). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds's free throw rate sits at 30.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Colgate Raiders check in at 28.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Loyola (MD) Greyhounds convert 71.4% while Colgate Raiders hit 72.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
