The early betting action has shaped into Louisville Cardinals favored by 17.5 points, with the total sitting at 152.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 17.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Notre Dame Fighting Irish to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Louisville Cardinals to play below their standard. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Louisville Cardinals</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 119.91 (ranked #25 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 34.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Notre Dame Fighting Irish</strong> counter with 109.73 offensive efficiency (#147). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Louisville Cardinals's free throw rate sits at 34.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Notre Dame Fighting Irish check in at 34.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Louisville Cardinals convert 76.5% while Notre Dame Fighting Irish hit 69.9%. Louisville Cardinals's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>
