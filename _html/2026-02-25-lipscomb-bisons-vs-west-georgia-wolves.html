These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Lipscomb Bisons is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. West Georgia Wolves has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

<strong>Lipscomb Bisons</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.69 (ranked #124 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.6% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>West Georgia Wolves</strong> counter with 105.42 offensive efficiency (#238). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
