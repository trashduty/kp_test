These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Marshall Thundering Herd has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper.

The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Georgia Southern Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.99 (ranked #187 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Marshall Thundering Herd</strong> counter with 114.19 offensive efficiency (#76). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.6%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
