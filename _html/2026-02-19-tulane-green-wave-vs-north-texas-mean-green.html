<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
North Texas Mean Green (15-11) hosts Tulane Green Wave (15-10) at The Super Pit in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into North Texas Mean Green favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 137.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates North Texas Mean Green is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Tulane Green Wave has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 137.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Tulane Green Wave</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.65 (ranked #231 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>North Texas Mean Green</strong> counter with 101.62 offensive efficiency (#302). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Tulane Green Wave shoot 51.4% on two-pointers, while North Texas Mean Green convert at 47.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Tulane Green Wave's free throw rate sits at 45.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. North Texas Mean Green check in at 39.3, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Tulane Green Wave convert 76.8% while North Texas Mean Green hit 70.9%. Tulane Green Wave's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, North Texas Mean Green get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Tulane Green Wave is simply the superior team on paper.
