<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
LIU Sharks (12-8) hosts Le Moyne Dolphins (11-10) at Steinberg Wellness Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into LIU Sharks favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates LIU Sharks is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Le Moyne Dolphins has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Le Moyne Dolphins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.81 (ranked #176 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.3% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>LIU Sharks</strong> counter with 106.84 offensive efficiency (#200). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Le Moyne Dolphins operate at a 68.6 tempo (#208), while LIU Sharks play at 69.4 (#152). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.0) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Le Moyne Dolphins shoot 52.5% on two-pointers, while LIU Sharks convert at 51.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Le Moyne Dolphins's free throw rate sits at 40.4, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. LIU Sharks check in at 32.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Le Moyne Dolphins convert 72.6% while LIU Sharks hit 63.7%. Le Moyne Dolphins's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, LIU Sharks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Le Moyne Dolphins is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Nate Champion leads Le Moyne Dolphins while Rod Strickland guides LIU Sharks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, LIU Sharks holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but Le Moyne Dolphins could make this interesting if they play to their potential. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
Both teams are fairly evenly matched on both ends of the floor. This could come down to execution in crunch time.
