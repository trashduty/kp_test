These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates BYU Cougars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Oklahoma St Cowboys has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Oklahoma St Cowboys</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.75 (ranked #84 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>BYU Cougars</strong> counter with 121.41 offensive efficiency (#16). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
