<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
South Alabama Jaguars (21-9) hosts Southern Miss Golden Eagles (15-15) at Mitchell Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into South Alabama Jaguars favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates South Alabama Jaguars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Southern Miss Golden Eagles has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Southern Miss Golden Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.21 (ranked #271 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>South Alabama Jaguars</strong> counter with 109.11 offensive efficiency (#163). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Southern Miss Golden Eagles operate at a 69.7 tempo (#122), while South Alabama Jaguars play at 65.7 (#312). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Southern Miss Golden Eagles shoot 51.4% on two-pointers, while South Alabama Jaguars convert at 53.9%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Southern Miss Golden Eagles's free throw rate sits at 42.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. South Alabama Jaguars check in at 38.7, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Southern Miss Golden Eagles convert 73.4% while South Alabama Jaguars hit 66.2%. Southern Miss Golden Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, South Alabama Jaguars get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Southern Miss Golden Eagles is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Jay Ladner leads Southern Miss Golden Eagles while Richie Riley guides South Alabama Jaguars. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
