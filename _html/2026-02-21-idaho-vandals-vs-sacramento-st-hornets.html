These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Idaho Vandals is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Sacramento St Hornets has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Idaho Vandals</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.41 (ranked #156 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Idaho Vandals's free throw rate sits at 34.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Sacramento St Hornets check in at 42.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Idaho Vandals convert 74.0% while Sacramento St Hornets hit 78.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
