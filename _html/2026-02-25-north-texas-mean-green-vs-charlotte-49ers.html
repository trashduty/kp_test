<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
North Texas Mean Green (16-12) travels to face Charlotte 49ers (14-13) at Halton Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Charlotte 49ers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Charlotte 49ers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>North Texas Mean Green</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.34 (ranked #293 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.1% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Charlotte 49ers</strong> counter with 111.71 offensive efficiency (#104). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<p>
North Texas Mean Green operate at a 66.2 tempo (#292), while Charlotte 49ers play at 64.3 (#347). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.2) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. North Texas Mean Green's free throw rate sits at 40.4, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Charlotte 49ers check in at 36.8, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, North Texas Mean Green convert 71.2% while Charlotte 49ers hit 70.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
