<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>

The early betting action has shaped into Massachusetts Minutemen favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Massachusetts Minutemen has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Eastern Michigan Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Eastern Michigan Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.59 (ranked #275 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Massachusetts Minutemen</strong> counter with 108.88 offensive efficiency (#163). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
