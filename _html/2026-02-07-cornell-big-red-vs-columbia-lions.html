<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When Cornell Big Red (10-10) travels to face Columbia Lions (14-7) at Levien Gymnasium, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Columbia Lions favored by 2.0 points, with the total sitting at 172.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Columbia Lions's 2.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 172.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Cornell Big Red</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 119.16 (ranked #31 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.3% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Columbia Lions</strong> counter with 112.05 offensive efficiency (#101). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.4%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Cornell Big Red operate at a 72.9 tempo (#22), while Columbia Lions play at 67.9 (#224). Cornell Big Red want to run, but Columbia Lions prefer to slow things down.

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Cornell Big Red shoot 58.2% on two-pointers, while Columbia Lions convert at 54.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Cornell Big Red's free throw rate sits at 31.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Columbia Lions check in at 30.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Cornell Big Red convert 73.8% while Columbia Lions hit 73.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
