<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking South Carolina Gamecocks to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Georgia Bulldogs to play below their standard. The total of 159.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>South Carolina Gamecocks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.81 (ranked #145 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 30.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Georgia Bulldogs</strong> counter with 120.06 offensive efficiency (#19). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>
