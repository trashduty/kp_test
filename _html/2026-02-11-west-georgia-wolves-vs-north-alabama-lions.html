<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
West Georgia Wolves (11-13) travels to face North Alabama Lions (7-16) at CB&S Bank Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into North Alabama Lions favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 150.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. North Alabama Lions's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>West Georgia Wolves</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.86 (ranked #241 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>North Alabama Lions</strong> counter with 101.95 offensive efficiency (#296). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
West Georgia Wolves operate at a 70.1 tempo (#113), while North Alabama Lions play at 66.0 (#309). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.0) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, West Georgia Wolves shoot 47.3% on two-pointers, while North Alabama Lions convert at 48.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. West Georgia Wolves's free throw rate sits at 30.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. North Alabama Lions check in at 36.7, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, West Georgia Wolves convert 71.4% while North Alabama Lions hit 68.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, North Alabama Lions get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Dave Moore leads West Georgia Wolves while Tony Pujol guides North Alabama Lions. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
