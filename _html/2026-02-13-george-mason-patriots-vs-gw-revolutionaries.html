<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When George Mason Patriots (21-4) travels to face GW Revolutionaries (14-11) at Charles E. Smith Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. GW Revolutionaries's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>George Mason Patriots</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.71 (ranked #79 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>GW Revolutionaries</strong> counter with 117.01 offensive efficiency (#52). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

</p>
