<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Quinnipiac Bobcats (16-9) hosts Niagara Purple Eagles (6-17) at M&T Bank Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Quinnipiac Bobcats favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 137.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Niagara Purple Eagles to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Quinnipiac Bobcats to play below their standard. The total of 137.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Niagara Purple Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 98.63 (ranked #325 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Quinnipiac Bobcats</strong> counter with 106.42 offensive efficiency (#212). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Niagara Purple Eagles operate at a 63.4 tempo (#362), while Quinnipiac Bobcats play at 71.0 (#78). Quinnipiac Bobcats like to push the pace, while Niagara Purple Eagles want to control the clock. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 67.2) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Niagara Purple Eagles shoot 49.0% on two-pointers, while Quinnipiac Bobcats convert at 48.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Niagara Purple Eagles's free throw rate sits at 25.1, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Quinnipiac Bobcats check in at 32.3, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Niagara Purple Eagles convert 70.2% while Quinnipiac Bobcats hit 70.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Quinnipiac Bobcats get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Niagara Purple Eagles is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Greg Paulus leads Niagara Purple Eagles while Tom Pecora guides Quinnipiac Bobcats. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
