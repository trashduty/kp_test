<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
New Mexico Lobos (19-6) hosts Air Force Falcons (3-22) at The Pit in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into New Mexico Lobos favored by 27.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 27.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Air Force Falcons to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires New Mexico Lobos to play below their standard. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Air Force Falcons</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 91.29 (ranked #363 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>New Mexico Lobos</strong> counter with 113.74 offensive efficiency (#79). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Air Force Falcons operate at a 67.2 tempo (#248), while New Mexico Lobos play at 70.8 (#77). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.0) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Air Force Falcons shoot 51.0% on two-pointers, while New Mexico Lobos convert at 53.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Air Force Falcons's free throw rate sits at 35.5, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. New Mexico Lobos check in at 36.2, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Air Force Falcons convert 64.7% while New Mexico Lobos hit 74.5%. New Mexico Lobos's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, New Mexico Lobos get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Air Force Falcons is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Joe Scott leads Air Force Falcons while Eric Olen guides New Mexico Lobos. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with New Mexico Lobos significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Air Force Falcons will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<h2>Air Force Falcons</h2>

<p>
