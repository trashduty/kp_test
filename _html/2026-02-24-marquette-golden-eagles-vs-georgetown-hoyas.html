<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Georgetown Hoyas (13-14) hosts Marquette Golden Eagles (9-18) at Capital One Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Georgetown Hoyas favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Georgetown Hoyas is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Marquette Golden Eagles has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Marquette Golden Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.36 (ranked #221 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Georgetown Hoyas</strong> counter with 109.74 offensive efficiency (#150). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Marquette Golden Eagles operate at a 70.3 tempo (#92), while Georgetown Hoyas play at 67.2 (#243). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.8) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Marquette Golden Eagles shoot 51.6% on two-pointers, while Georgetown Hoyas convert at 49.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Marquette Golden Eagles's free throw rate sits at 32.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Georgetown Hoyas check in at 39.6, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Marquette Golden Eagles convert 68.0% while Georgetown Hoyas hit 73.7%. Georgetown Hoyas's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Georgetown Hoyas get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Shaka Smart leads Marquette Golden Eagles while Ed Cooley guides Georgetown Hoyas. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, Georgetown Hoyas holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but Marquette Golden Eagles could make this interesting if they play to their potential. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
