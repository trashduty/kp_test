<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When Baylor Bears (11-9) travels to face West Virginia Mountaineers (14-7) at Hope Coliseum, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into West Virginia Mountaineers favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 141.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. West Virginia Mountaineers's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Baylor Bears</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 116.26 (ranked #60 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>West Virginia Mountaineers</strong> counter with 110.35 offensive efficiency (#130). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Baylor Bears operate at a 70.9 tempo (#83), while West Virginia Mountaineers play at 64.2 (#355). Baylor Bears want to run, but West Virginia Mountaineers prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 67.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Baylor Bears shoot 54.1% on two-pointers, while West Virginia Mountaineers convert at 51.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Baylor Bears's free throw rate sits at 37.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. West Virginia Mountaineers check in at 36.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Baylor Bears convert 71.6% while West Virginia Mountaineers hit 68.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, West Virginia Mountaineers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Scott Drew leads Baylor Bears while Ross Hodge guides West Virginia Mountaineers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
