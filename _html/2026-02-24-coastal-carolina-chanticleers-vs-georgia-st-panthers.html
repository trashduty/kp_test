<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Coastal Carolina Chanticleers (17-12) travels to face Georgia St Panthers (10-19) at GSU Convocation Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Georgia St Panthers favored by 0.0 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Georgia St Panthers's 0.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Coastal Carolina Chanticleers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.04 (ranked #298 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Georgia St Panthers</strong> counter with 98.88 offensive efficiency (#335). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Coastal Carolina Chanticleers operate at a 68.6 tempo (#185), while Georgia St Panthers play at 68.6 (#179). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.6) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Coastal Carolina Chanticleers shoot 45.8% on two-pointers, while Georgia St Panthers convert at 41.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers's free throw rate sits at 32.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Georgia St Panthers check in at 36.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Coastal Carolina Chanticleers convert 72.3% while Georgia St Panthers hit 79.2%. Georgia St Panthers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Georgia St Panthers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Coastal Carolina Chanticleers. 
From a coaching perspective, Justin Gray leads Coastal Carolina Chanticleers while Jonas Hayes guides Georgia St Panthers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
