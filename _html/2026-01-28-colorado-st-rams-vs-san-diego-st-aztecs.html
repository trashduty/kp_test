<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
San Diego St Aztecs (14-5) hosts Colorado St Rams (12-8) at Viejas Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into San Diego St Aztecs favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 141.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us San Diego St Aztecs has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Colorado St Rams needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Colorado St Rams</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 119.21 (ranked #32 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 41.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>San Diego St Aztecs</strong> counter with 109.33 offensive efficiency (#158). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.4%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 67.0) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>

From a coaching perspective, Ali Farokhmanesh leads Colorado St Rams while Brian Dutcher guides San Diego St Aztecs. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
