<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Oakland Golden Grizzlies (16-14) hosts Detroit Mercy Titans (14-14) at OU Credit Union O'rena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Oakland Golden Grizzlies has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Detroit Mercy Titans needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 161.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Detroit Mercy Titans</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.58 (ranked #174 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Oakland Golden Grizzlies</strong> counter with 114.32 offensive efficiency (#73). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Detroit Mercy Titans operate at a 70.1 tempo (#103), while Oakland Golden Grizzlies play at 71.0 (#58). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.5) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Detroit Mercy Titans's free throw rate sits at 31.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Oakland Golden Grizzlies check in at 39.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Detroit Mercy Titans convert 78.5% while Oakland Golden Grizzlies hit 75.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
