<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Campbell Fighting Camels (13-15) travels to face Drexel Dragons (15-14) at Daskalakis Athletic Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Drexel Dragons favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 142.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Drexel Dragons's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Campbell Fighting Camels</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.29 (ranked #199 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Drexel Dragons</strong> counter with 103.56 offensive efficiency (#278). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Campbell Fighting Camels shoot 50.2% on two-pointers, while Drexel Dragons convert at 50.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Campbell Fighting Camels's free throw rate sits at 43.3, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Drexel Dragons check in at 31.4, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Campbell Fighting Camels convert 72.1% while Drexel Dragons hit 65.4%. Campbell Fighting Camels's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>
