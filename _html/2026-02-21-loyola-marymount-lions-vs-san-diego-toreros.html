<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Loyola Marymount Lions (13-15) travels to face San Diego Toreros (11-17) at Jenny Craig Pavilion in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Loyola Marymount Lions favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Loyola Marymount Lions's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Loyola Marymount Lions</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.83 (ranked #250 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>San Diego Toreros</strong> counter with 104.77 offensive efficiency (#252). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Loyola Marymount Lions operate at a 68.8 tempo (#172), while San Diego Toreros play at 69.7 (#122). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Loyola Marymount Lions shoot 51.9% on two-pointers, while San Diego Toreros convert at 51.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Loyola Marymount Lions's free throw rate sits at 30.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. San Diego Toreros check in at 26.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Loyola Marymount Lions convert 68.7% while San Diego Toreros hit 74.9%. San Diego Toreros's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, San Diego Toreros get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Loyola Marymount Lions. 
From a coaching perspective, Stan Johnson leads Loyola Marymount Lions while Steve Lavin guides San Diego Toreros. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
