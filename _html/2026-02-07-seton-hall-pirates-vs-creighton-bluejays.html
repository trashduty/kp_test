<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Seton Hall Pirates (16-7) travels to face Creighton Bluejays (12-11) at CHI Health Center Omaha in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Creighton Bluejays favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Creighton Bluejays's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Seton Hall Pirates</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.95 (ranked #196 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Creighton Bluejays</strong> counter with 111.65 offensive efficiency (#110). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Seton Hall Pirates operate at a 66.9 tempo (#264), while Creighton Bluejays play at 68.4 (#210). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Seton Hall Pirates shoot 47.9% on two-pointers, while Creighton Bluejays convert at 57.5%. Creighton Bluejays has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Seton Hall Pirates's free throw rate sits at 35.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Creighton Bluejays check in at 27.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Seton Hall Pirates convert 73.0% while Creighton Bluejays hit 74.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Creighton Bluejays get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Seton Hall Pirates. 
From a coaching perspective, Shaheen Holloway leads Seton Hall Pirates while Greg McDermott guides Creighton Bluejays. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, Seton Hall Pirates holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but Creighton Bluejays could make this interesting if they play to their potential. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
