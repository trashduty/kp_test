<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
St. John's Red Storm (21-5) hosts Creighton Bluejays (14-13) at Carnesecca Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into St. John's Red Storm favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Creighton Bluejays to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires St. John's Red Storm to play below their standard. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Creighton Bluejays</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.34 (ranked #110 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>St. John's Red Storm</strong> counter with 116.37 offensive efficiency (#57). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Creighton Bluejays operate at a 68.4 tempo (#192), while St. John's Red Storm play at 71.9 (#35). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Creighton Bluejays's free throw rate sits at 27.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. St. John's Red Storm check in at 43.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Creighton Bluejays convert 75.2% while St. John's Red Storm hit 72.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
