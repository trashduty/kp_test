<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Marshall Thundering Herd (14-8) hosts Southern Miss Golden Eagles (12-12) at Henderson Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Marshall Thundering Herd favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Marshall Thundering Herd has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Southern Miss Golden Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Southern Miss Golden Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.60 (ranked #260 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 26.8% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Marshall Thundering Herd</strong> counter with 112.02 offensive efficiency (#107). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.8%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Southern Miss Golden Eagles's free throw rate sits at 42.7, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Marshall Thundering Herd check in at 29.3, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Southern Miss Golden Eagles convert 74.1% while Marshall Thundering Herd hit 73.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
