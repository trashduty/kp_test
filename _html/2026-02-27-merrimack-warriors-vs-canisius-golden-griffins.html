These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Merrimack Warriors has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Canisius Golden Griffins needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Merrimack Warriors</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.28 (ranked #200 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Canisius Golden Griffins</strong> counter with 95.85 offensive efficiency (#351). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
