The 4.5-point spread indicates Albany Great Danes is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Binghamton Bearcats has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
