<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Eastern Kentucky Colonels (8-16) hosts Stetson Hatters (8-16) at Baptist Health Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Eastern Kentucky Colonels has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Stetson Hatters needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Stetson Hatters</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.03 (ranked #304 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Eastern Kentucky Colonels</strong> counter with 109.34 offensive efficiency (#156). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
