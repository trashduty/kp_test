<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When West Virginia Mountaineers (15-9) travels to face UCF Knights (17-6) at Addition Financial Arena, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into UCF Knights favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates UCF Knights is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. West Virginia Mountaineers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>West Virginia Mountaineers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.36 (ranked #174 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>UCF Knights</strong> counter with 115.87 offensive efficiency (#64). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.3%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
West Virginia Mountaineers operate at a 63.9 tempo (#357), while UCF Knights play at 71.1 (#71). UCF Knights like to push the pace, while West Virginia Mountaineers want to control the clock. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 67.5) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, West Virginia Mountaineers shoot 52.2% on two-pointers, while UCF Knights convert at 52.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. West Virginia Mountaineers's free throw rate sits at 37.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. UCF Knights check in at 30.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, West Virginia Mountaineers convert 67.3% while UCF Knights hit 74.3%. UCF Knights's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, UCF Knights get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Ross Hodge leads West Virginia Mountaineers while Johnny Dawkins guides UCF Knights. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
