<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Creighton Bluejays (14-14) hosts DePaul Blue Demons (14-13) at CHI Health Center Omaha in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Creighton Bluejays favored by 5.0 points, with the total sitting at 142.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.0-point spread indicates Creighton Bluejays is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. DePaul Blue Demons has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>DePaul Blue Demons</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.23 (ranked #246 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Creighton Bluejays</strong> counter with 109.85 offensive efficiency (#143). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
DePaul Blue Demons operate at a 67.9 tempo (#217), while Creighton Bluejays play at 68.6 (#177). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.2) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, DePaul Blue Demons shoot 51.5% on two-pointers, while Creighton Bluejays convert at 55.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. DePaul Blue Demons's free throw rate sits at 37.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Creighton Bluejays check in at 28.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, DePaul Blue Demons convert 69.0% while Creighton Bluejays hit 74.9%. Creighton Bluejays's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Creighton Bluejays get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—DePaul Blue Demons is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Holtmann leads DePaul Blue Demons while Greg McDermott guides Creighton Bluejays. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
