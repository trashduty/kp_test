<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Creighton Bluejays (12-8) travels to face Marquette Golden Eagles (7-14) at Fiserv Forum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Creighton Bluejays favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 155.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Creighton Bluejays's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 155.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Creighton Bluejays</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 114.40 (ranked #78 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Marquette Golden Eagles</strong> counter with 105.23 offensive efficiency (#228). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Creighton Bluejays operate at a 68.6 tempo (#208), while Marquette Golden Eagles play at 70.9 (#85). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.8) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Creighton Bluejays shoot 57.0% on two-pointers, while Marquette Golden Eagles convert at 50.5%. Creighton Bluejays has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Creighton Bluejays's free throw rate sits at 27.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Marquette Golden Eagles check in at 34.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Creighton Bluejays convert 75.5% while Marquette Golden Eagles hit 67.8%. Creighton Bluejays's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Marquette Golden Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Creighton Bluejays. 
From a coaching perspective, Greg McDermott leads Creighton Bluejays while Shaka Smart guides Marquette Golden Eagles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
