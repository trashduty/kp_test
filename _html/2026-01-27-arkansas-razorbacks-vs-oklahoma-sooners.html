These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Arkansas Razorbacks's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent disparity.

<strong>Arkansas Razorbacks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 122.69 (ranked #12 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways.

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Oklahoma Sooners</strong> counter with 119.40 offensive efficiency (#31). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
