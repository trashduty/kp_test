These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Charleston Cougars has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. North Carolina A&T Aggies needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Charleston Cougars</strong> counter with 110.27 offensive efficiency (#136). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
