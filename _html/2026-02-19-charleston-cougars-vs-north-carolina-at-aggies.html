These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Charleston Cougars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. North Carolina A&T Aggies has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Charleston Cougars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.47 (ranked #174 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>North Carolina A&T Aggies</strong> counter with 105.06 offensive efficiency (#239). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
