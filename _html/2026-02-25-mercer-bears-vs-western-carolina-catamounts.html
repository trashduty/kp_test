<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Mercer Bears (18-11) travels to face Western Carolina Catamounts (12-15) at Ramsey Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Mercer Bears favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 160.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Mercer Bears's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 160.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Mercer Bears</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 115.43 (ranked #62 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Western Carolina Catamounts</strong> counter with 110.33 offensive efficiency (#129). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Mercer Bears operate at a 69.8 tempo (#116), while Western Carolina Catamounts play at 69.2 (#144). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.5) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Mercer Bears's free throw rate sits at 38.4, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Western Carolina Catamounts check in at 30.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Mercer Bears convert 74.1% while Western Carolina Catamounts hit 70.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
