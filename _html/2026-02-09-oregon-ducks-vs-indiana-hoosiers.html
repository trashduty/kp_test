<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Indiana Hoosiers (16-8) hosts Oregon Ducks (8-15) at Assembly Hall in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Indiana Hoosiers favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 142.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Indiana Hoosiers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Oregon Ducks needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Oregon Ducks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.40 (ranked #209 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Indiana Hoosiers</strong> counter with 117.19 offensive efficiency (#50). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Oregon Ducks operate at a 66.8 tempo (#269), while Indiana Hoosiers play at 68.1 (#218). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.4) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Oregon Ducks shoot 50.7% on two-pointers, while Indiana Hoosiers convert at 59.2%. Indiana Hoosiers has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Oregon Ducks's free throw rate sits at 35.5, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Indiana Hoosiers check in at 36.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Oregon Ducks convert 71.3% while Indiana Hoosiers hit 78.8%. Indiana Hoosiers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Indiana Hoosiers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Oregon Ducks is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Dana Altman leads Oregon Ducks while Darian DeVries guides Indiana Hoosiers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Indiana Hoosiers significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Oregon Ducks will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: Indiana Hoosiers's Offense vs Oregon Ducks's Defense</strong>

</p>

<h2>Oregon Ducks</h2>
