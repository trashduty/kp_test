The early betting action has shaped into Lindenwood Lions favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 153.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Lindenwood Lions's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Lindenwood Lions</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.10 (ranked #294 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles</strong> counter with 103.87 offensive efficiency (#272). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Lindenwood Lions shoot 51.1% on two-pointers, while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles convert at 50.5%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Lindenwood Lions's free throw rate sits at 39.3, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact.

When they do get fouled, Lindenwood Lions convert 67.7% while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles hit 75.1%. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>
