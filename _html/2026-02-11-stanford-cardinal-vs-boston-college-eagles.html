<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Stanford Cardinal (15-9) travels to face Boston College Eagles (9-14) at Conte Forum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Stanford Cardinal favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 135.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Stanford Cardinal's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 135.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Stanford Cardinal</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.81 (ranked #146 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Boston College Eagles</strong> counter with 99.46 offensive efficiency (#318). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Stanford Cardinal operate at a 69.0 tempo (#167), while Boston College Eagles play at 66.1 (#301). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Stanford Cardinal shoot 49.4% on two-pointers, while Boston College Eagles convert at 48.5%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Stanford Cardinal's free throw rate sits at 38.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Boston College Eagles check in at 34.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Stanford Cardinal convert 72.6% while Boston College Eagles hit 65.5%. Stanford Cardinal's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Boston College Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Stanford Cardinal. 
From a coaching perspective, Kyle Smith leads Stanford Cardinal while Earl Grant guides Boston College Eagles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
