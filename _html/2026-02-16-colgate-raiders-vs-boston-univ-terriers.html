<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Colgate Raiders (16-11) travels to face Boston Univ. Terriers (12-15) at Case Gym in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Colgate Raiders favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Colgate Raiders's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Colgate Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.83 (ranked #145 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Boston Univ. Terriers</strong> counter with 113.28 offensive efficiency (#82). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.4%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Colgate Raiders operate at a 67.1 tempo (#253), while Boston Univ. Terriers play at 64.1 (#352). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Colgate Raiders shoot 53.5% on two-pointers, while Boston Univ. Terriers convert at 55.9%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Colgate Raiders's free throw rate sits at 29.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Boston Univ. Terriers check in at 33.8, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Colgate Raiders convert 72.5% while Boston Univ. Terriers hit 72.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
