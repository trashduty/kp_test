<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Boston Univ. Terriers (10-15) travels to face Army Knights (10-15) at Christl Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Boston Univ. Terriers favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Boston Univ. Terriers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Army Knights has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Boston Univ. Terriers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.82 (ranked #104 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.8% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Army Knights</strong> counter with 103.22 offensive efficiency (#270). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Boston Univ. Terriers's free throw rate sits at 32.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
