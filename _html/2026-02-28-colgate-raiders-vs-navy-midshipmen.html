<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen (24-6) hosts Colgate Raiders (17-13) at Alumni Hall in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Navy Midshipmen is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Colgate Raiders has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Colgate Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.76 (ranked #147 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Navy Midshipmen</strong> counter with 111.67 offensive efficiency (#107). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Colgate Raiders operate at a 66.9 tempo (#255), while Navy Midshipmen play at 65.4 (#324). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Colgate Raiders shoot 52.8% on two-pointers, while Navy Midshipmen convert at 52.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Colgate Raiders's free throw rate sits at 29.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Navy Midshipmen check in at 39.4, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Colgate Raiders convert 74.1% while Navy Midshipmen hit 74.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Navy Midshipmen get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Colgate Raiders is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Matt Langel leads Colgate Raiders while Jon Perry guides Navy Midshipmen. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>
