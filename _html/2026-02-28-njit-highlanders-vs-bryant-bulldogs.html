<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders (15-14) travels to face Bryant Bulldogs (8-20) at Chace Athletic Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into NJIT Highlanders favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. NJIT Highlanders's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>NJIT Highlanders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 99.70 (ranked #328 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Bryant Bulldogs</strong> counter with 95.73 offensive efficiency (#352). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders operate at a 68.2 tempo (#198), while Bryant Bulldogs play at 64.7 (#340). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.5) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, NJIT Highlanders shoot 47.9% on two-pointers, while Bryant Bulldogs convert at 48.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. NJIT Highlanders's free throw rate sits at 34.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Bryant Bulldogs check in at 28.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, NJIT Highlanders convert 70.6% while Bryant Bulldogs hit 76.1%. Bryant Bulldogs's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Bryant Bulldogs get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for NJIT Highlanders. 
From a coaching perspective, Grant Billmeier leads NJIT Highlanders while Jamion Christian guides Bryant Bulldogs. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, NJIT Highlanders holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but Bryant Bulldogs could make this interesting if they play to their potential.

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
