These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates GW Revolutionaries is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Rhode Island Rams has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Rhode Island Rams</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.14 (ranked #159 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>GW Revolutionaries</strong> counter with 117.28 offensive efficiency (#48). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
