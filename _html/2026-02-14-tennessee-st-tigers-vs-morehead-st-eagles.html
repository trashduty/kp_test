The early betting action has shaped into Tennessee St Tigers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 151.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Tennessee St Tigers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Tennessee St Tigers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.23 (ranked #178 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Morehead St Eagles</strong> counter with 105.06 offensive efficiency (#238). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>

Getting to the line matters too. Tennessee St Tigers's free throw rate sits at 32.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Morehead St Eagles check in at 36.2, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Tennessee St Tigers convert 74.2% while Morehead St Eagles hit 74.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
