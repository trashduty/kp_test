</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Butler Bulldogs to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires St. John's Red Storm to play below their standard.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Butler Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 114.75 (ranked #72 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
