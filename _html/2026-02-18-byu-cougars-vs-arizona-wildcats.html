These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Arizona Wildcats has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. BYU Cougars needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>BYU Cougars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 120.93 (ranked #18 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
