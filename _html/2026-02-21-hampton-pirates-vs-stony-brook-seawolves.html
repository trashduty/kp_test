These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Stony Brook Seawolves is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Hampton Pirates has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Hampton Pirates</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.58 (ranked #313 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Stony Brook Seawolves</strong> counter with 104.95 offensive efficiency (#242). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
