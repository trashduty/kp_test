<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
American Eagles (13-8) travels to face Loyola (MD) Greyhounds (7-14) at Reitz Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into American Eagles favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 149.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates American Eagles is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 149.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>American Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.32 (ranked #191 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Loyola (MD) Greyhounds</strong> counter with 104.68 offensive efficiency (#238). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
American Eagles operate at a 67.6 tempo (#236), while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds play at 68.7 (#203). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, American Eagles shoot 53.5% on two-pointers, while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds convert at 52.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. American Eagles's free throw rate sits at 28.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds check in at 32.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, American Eagles convert 77.4% while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds hit 69.0%. American Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Loyola (MD) Greyhounds get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for American Eagles. 
From a coaching perspective, Duane Simpkins leads American Eagles while Josh Loeffler guides Loyola (MD) Greyhounds. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with American Eagles significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds will need their best performance to stay competitive.
