<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Yale Bulldogs (16-3) hosts Harvard Crimson (11-9) at Lee Amphitheater in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Yale Bulldogs favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Harvard Crimson to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Yale Bulldogs to play below their standard. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Harvard Crimson</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.60 (ranked #147 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Yale Bulldogs</strong> counter with 123.80 offensive efficiency (#6). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 41.9%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Harvard Crimson operate at a 64.6 tempo (#346), while Yale Bulldogs play at 67.0 (#268). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Harvard Crimson shoot 53.3% on two-pointers, while Yale Bulldogs convert at 53.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Harvard Crimson's free throw rate sits at 26.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Yale Bulldogs check in at 35.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Harvard Crimson convert 81.8% while Yale Bulldogs hit 78.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Yale Bulldogs get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Harvard Crimson is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Tommy Amaker leads Harvard Crimson while James Jones guides Yale Bulldogs. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
