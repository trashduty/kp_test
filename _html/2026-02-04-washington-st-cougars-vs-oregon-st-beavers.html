<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Washington St Cougars (11-13) travels to face Oregon St Beavers (12-12) at Gill Coliseum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Washington St Cougars favored by 2.0 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Washington St Cougars's 2.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Washington St Cougars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.33 (ranked #114 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Oregon St Beavers</strong> counter with 104.07 offensive efficiency (#251). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Washington St Cougars operate at a 69.0 tempo (#181), while Oregon St Beavers play at 66.7 (#281). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Washington St Cougars shoot 56.3% on two-pointers, while Oregon St Beavers convert at 48.7%. Washington St Cougars has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Washington St Cougars's free throw rate sits at 32.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Oregon St Beavers check in at 44.4, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Washington St Cougars convert 73.3% while Oregon St Beavers hit 77.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Oregon St Beavers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Washington St Cougars. 
From a coaching perspective, David Riley leads Washington St Cougars while Wayne Tinkle guides Oregon St Beavers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>
