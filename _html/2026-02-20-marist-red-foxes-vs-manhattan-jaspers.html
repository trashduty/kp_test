These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Marist Red Foxes is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Manhattan Jaspers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Marist Red Foxes</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.39 (ranked #277 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Manhattan Jaspers</strong> counter with 106.41 offensive efficiency (#216). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Marist Red Foxes's free throw rate sits at 26.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Manhattan Jaspers check in at 34.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Marist Red Foxes convert 79.3% while Manhattan Jaspers hit 79.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
