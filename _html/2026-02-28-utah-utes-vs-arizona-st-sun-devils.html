<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Arizona St Sun Devils is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Utah Utes has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Utah Utes</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.38 (ranked #177 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
