<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Tenn-Martin Skyhawks (20-9) hosts Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles (13-16) at Elam Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Tenn-Martin Skyhawks favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 135.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Tenn-Martin Skyhawks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 135.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.06 (ranked #271 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tenn-Martin Skyhawks</strong> counter with 104.67 offensive efficiency (#259). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles operate at a 68.4 tempo (#194), while Tenn-Martin Skyhawks play at 66.3 (#287). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles shoot 50.5% on two-pointers, while Tenn-Martin Skyhawks convert at 52.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles's free throw rate sits at 33.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Tenn-Martin Skyhawks check in at 39.7, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles convert 75.5% while Tenn-Martin Skyhawks hit 67.1%. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Tenn-Martin Skyhawks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, John Pelphrey leads Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles while Jeremy Shulman guides Tenn-Martin Skyhawks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
