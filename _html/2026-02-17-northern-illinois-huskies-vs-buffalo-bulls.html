<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Buffalo Bulls has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Northern Illinois Huskies needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Northern Illinois Huskies</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 96.96 (ranked #343 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Buffalo Bulls</strong> counter with 114.92 offensive efficiency (#69). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Buffalo Bulls check in at 40.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Northern Illinois Huskies convert 65.4% while Buffalo Bulls hit 74.3%. Buffalo Bulls's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
