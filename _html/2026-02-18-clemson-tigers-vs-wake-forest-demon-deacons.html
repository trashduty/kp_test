These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Clemson Tigers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Wake Forest Demon Deacons has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Clemson Tigers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 112.78 (ranked #90 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Wake Forest Demon Deacons</strong> counter with 111.56 offensive efficiency (#108). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
