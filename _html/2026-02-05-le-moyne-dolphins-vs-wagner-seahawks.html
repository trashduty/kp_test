<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Le Moyne Dolphins (11-12) travels to face Wagner Seahawks (7-13) at Spiro Sports Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Le Moyne Dolphins favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 141.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Le Moyne Dolphins's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Le Moyne Dolphins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.12 (ranked #230 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Wagner Seahawks</strong> counter with 105.71 offensive efficiency (#222). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Le Moyne Dolphins operate at a 69.0 tempo (#176), while Wagner Seahawks play at 65.0 (#334). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.0) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Le Moyne Dolphins shoot 51.5% on two-pointers, while Wagner Seahawks convert at 47.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Le Moyne Dolphins's free throw rate sits at 39.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Wagner Seahawks check in at 31.4, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Le Moyne Dolphins convert 71.8% while Wagner Seahawks hit 70.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Wagner Seahawks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Le Moyne Dolphins. 
From a coaching perspective, Nate Champion leads Le Moyne Dolphins while Dwan McMillan guides Wagner Seahawks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
