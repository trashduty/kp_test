These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Bethune-Cookman Wildcats's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

</p>

<strong>Bethune-Cookman Wildcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.79 (ranked #274 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Grambling St Tigers</strong> counter with 100.28 offensive efficiency (#318). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
