<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders (13-12) travels to face New Hampshire Wildcats (8-14) at Lundholm Gymnasium in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into New Hampshire Wildcats favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. New Hampshire Wildcats's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>NJIT Highlanders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 98.85 (ranked #327 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>New Hampshire Wildcats</strong> counter with 96.35 offensive efficiency (#346). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.2%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders operate at a 68.9 tempo (#176), while New Hampshire Wildcats play at 67.7 (#228). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, NJIT Highlanders shoot 46.6% on two-pointers, while New Hampshire Wildcats convert at 46.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. NJIT Highlanders's free throw rate sits at 34.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. New Hampshire Wildcats check in at 28.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, NJIT Highlanders convert 71.1% while New Hampshire Wildcats hit 68.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, New Hampshire Wildcats get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Grant Billmeier leads NJIT Highlanders while Nathan Davis guides New Hampshire Wildcats. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
