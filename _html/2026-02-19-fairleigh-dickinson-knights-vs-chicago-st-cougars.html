<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (10-17) travels to face Chicago St Cougars (6-21) at Jones Convocation Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Fairleigh Dickinson Knights favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 134.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 134.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Fairleigh Dickinson Knights</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.78 (ranked #310 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Chicago St Cougars</strong> counter with 97.96 offensive efficiency (#336). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Fairleigh Dickinson Knights operate at a 64.7 tempo (#339), while Chicago St Cougars play at 66.5 (#284). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights shoot 49.0% on two-pointers, while Chicago St Cougars convert at 43.4%. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights's free throw rate sits at 33.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Chicago St Cougars check in at 30.3, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights convert 70.2% while Chicago St Cougars hit 75.7%. Chicago St Cougars's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Chicago St Cougars get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Fairleigh Dickinson Knights. 
From a coaching perspective, Jack Castleberry leads Fairleigh Dickinson Knights while Landon Bussie guides Chicago St Cougars. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
