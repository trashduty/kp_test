<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Saint Peter's Peacocks (15-11) hosts Manhattan Jaspers (12-17) at Yanitelli Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Saint Peter's Peacocks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Manhattan Jaspers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Manhattan Jaspers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.52 (ranked #217 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Saint Peter's Peacocks</strong> counter with 105.28 offensive efficiency (#246). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

</p>

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
