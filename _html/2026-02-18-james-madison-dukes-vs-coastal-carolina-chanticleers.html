<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When James Madison Dukes (14-13) travels to face Coastal Carolina Chanticleers (16-11) at HTC Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Coastal Carolina Chanticleers favored by 0.0 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers's 0.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>James Madison Dukes</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.12 (ranked #141 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 36.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Coastal Carolina Chanticleers</strong> counter with 102.04 offensive efficiency (#295). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<p>
James Madison Dukes operate at a 66.7 tempo (#269), while Coastal Carolina Chanticleers play at 68.4 (#194). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. James Madison Dukes's free throw rate sits at 35.3, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers check in at 31.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, James Madison Dukes convert 69.4% while Coastal Carolina Chanticleers hit 72.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
