These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Georgia Southern Eagles is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Texas State Bobcats has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Texas State Bobcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.04 (ranked #287 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Georgia Southern Eagles</strong> counter with 109.19 offensive efficiency (#163). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>

Getting to the line matters too. Texas State Bobcats's free throw rate sits at 34.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Georgia Southern Eagles check in at 42.2, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Texas State Bobcats convert 75.2% while Georgia Southern Eagles hit 71.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
