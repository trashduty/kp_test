<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen (23-6) enters hostile territory as they take on Loyola (MD) Greyhounds (11-18) at Reitz Arena in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Navy Midshipmen has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Navy Midshipmen</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.06 (ranked #115 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Loyola (MD) Greyhounds</strong> counter with 106.18 offensive efficiency (#222). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<p>
Navy Midshipmen operate at a 65.5 tempo (#319), while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds play at 68.7 (#172). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<p>
Inside the paint, Navy Midshipmen shoot 52.6% on two-pointers, while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds convert at 51.9%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Navy Midshipmen's free throw rate sits at 39.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds check in at 30.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Navy Midshipmen convert 74.4% while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds hit 71.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
