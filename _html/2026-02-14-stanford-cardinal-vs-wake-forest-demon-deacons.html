<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Wake Forest Demon Deacons is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Stanford Cardinal has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Wake Forest Demon Deacons</strong> counter with 111.71 offensive efficiency (#104). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
