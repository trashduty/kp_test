<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen (20-6) travels to face Colgate Raiders (16-10) at Cotterell Court in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Navy Midshipmen's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Navy Midshipmen</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.12 (ranked #135 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Colgate Raiders</strong> counter with 109.75 offensive efficiency (#149). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen operate at a 65.7 tempo (#315), while Colgate Raiders play at 67.2 (#248). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.5) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Navy Midshipmen shoot 52.9% on two-pointers, while Colgate Raiders convert at 53.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Navy Midshipmen's free throw rate sits at 38.4, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Colgate Raiders check in at 28.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Navy Midshipmen convert 74.0% while Colgate Raiders hit 72.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Colgate Raiders get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Navy Midshipmen. 
From a coaching perspective, Jon Perry leads Navy Midshipmen while Matt Langel guides Colgate Raiders. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
