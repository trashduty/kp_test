</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Morehead St Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.90 (ranked #239 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>SE Missouri St Redhawks</strong> counter with 104.84 offensive efficiency (#240). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
