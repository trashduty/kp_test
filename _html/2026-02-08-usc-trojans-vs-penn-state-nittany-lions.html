The early betting action has shaped into USC Trojans favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at 155.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates USC Trojans is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Penn State Nittany Lions has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 155.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>USC Trojans</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.51 (ranked #129 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 32.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Penn State Nittany Lions</strong> counter with 112.50 offensive efficiency (#93). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 32.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
