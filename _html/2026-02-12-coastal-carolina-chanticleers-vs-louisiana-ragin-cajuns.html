<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Coastal Carolina Chanticleers (15-11) travels to face Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns (9-16) at Cajundome in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Coastal Carolina Chanticleers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 128.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 128.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Coastal Carolina Chanticleers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.17 (ranked #292 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns</strong> counter with 99.11 offensive efficiency (#325). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Coastal Carolina Chanticleers operate at a 68.4 tempo (#202), while Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns play at 63.1 (#365). Coastal Carolina Chanticleers want to run, but Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 65.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Coastal Carolina Chanticleers shoot 45.7% on two-pointers, while Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns convert at 46.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers's free throw rate sits at 30.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns check in at 26.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Coastal Carolina Chanticleers convert 72.1% while Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns hit 70.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>

Playing at home, Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Coastal Carolina Chanticleers. 
From a coaching perspective, Justin Gray leads Coastal Carolina Chanticleers while Quannas White guides Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
