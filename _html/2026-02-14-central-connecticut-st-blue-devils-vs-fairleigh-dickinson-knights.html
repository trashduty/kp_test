<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Central Connecticut St Blue Devils (14-10) travels to face Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (10-16) at Bogota Savings Bank Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Fairleigh Dickinson Knights favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Central Connecticut St Blue Devils</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.66 (ranked #169 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Fairleigh Dickinson Knights</strong> counter with 100.77 offensive efficiency (#309). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Central Connecticut St Blue Devils operate at a 65.5 tempo (#323), while Fairleigh Dickinson Knights play at 65.1 (#333). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Central Connecticut St Blue Devils shoot 50.6% on two-pointers, while Fairleigh Dickinson Knights convert at 49.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Central Connecticut St Blue Devils's free throw rate sits at 32.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights check in at 32.8, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Central Connecticut St Blue Devils convert 76.1% while Fairleigh Dickinson Knights hit 69.5%. Central Connecticut St Blue Devils's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
