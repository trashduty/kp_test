<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Boise State Broncos (13-8) travels to face Grand Canyon Antelopes (13-7) at Global Credit Union Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Grand Canyon Antelopes favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Grand Canyon Antelopes's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Boise State Broncos</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.33 (ranked #116 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Grand Canyon Antelopes</strong> counter with 106.06 offensive efficiency (#210). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.6%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<p>
Boise State Broncos operate at a 67.7 tempo (#233), while Grand Canyon Antelopes play at 69.2 (#171). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.5) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Boise State Broncos shoot 51.6% on two-pointers, while Grand Canyon Antelopes convert at 52.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Boise State Broncos's free throw rate sits at 43.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Grand Canyon Antelopes check in at 38.4, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Boise State Broncos convert 76.2% while Grand Canyon Antelopes hit 76.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
