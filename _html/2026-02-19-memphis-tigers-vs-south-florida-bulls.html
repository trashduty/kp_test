These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us South Florida Bulls has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Memphis Tigers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 158.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Memphis Tigers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.50 (ranked #257 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>South Florida Bulls</strong> counter with 116.58 offensive efficiency (#51). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Memphis Tigers's free throw rate sits at 34.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. South Florida Bulls check in at 42.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Memphis Tigers convert 72.4% while South Florida Bulls hit 73.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
