<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
SIU-Edwardsville Cougars (17-10) travels to face Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles (11-16) at Eblen Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into SIU-Edwardsville Cougars favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 136.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. SIU-Edwardsville Cougars's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 136.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>SIU-Edwardsville Cougars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.45 (ranked #275 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles</strong> counter with 104.37 offensive efficiency (#262). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
SIU-Edwardsville Cougars operate at a 65.9 tempo (#310), while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles play at 68.5 (#186). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.2) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, SIU-Edwardsville Cougars shoot 47.2% on two-pointers, while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles convert at 50.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. SIU-Edwardsville Cougars's free throw rate sits at 33.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles check in at 34.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, SIU-Edwardsville Cougars convert 68.2% while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles hit 74.6%. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for SIU-Edwardsville Cougars. 
From a coaching perspective, Brian Barone leads SIU-Edwardsville Cougars while John Pelphrey guides Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with SIU-Edwardsville Cougars significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles will need their best performance to stay competitive.
