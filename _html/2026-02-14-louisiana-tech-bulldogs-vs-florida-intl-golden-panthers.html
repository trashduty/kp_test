</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Louisiana Tech Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.12 (ranked #304 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 26.8% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Florida Int'l Golden Panthers</strong> counter with 106.68 offensive efficiency (#205). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
