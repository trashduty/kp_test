<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>

The early betting action has shaped into Lindenwood Lions favored by 5.0 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.0-point spread indicates Lindenwood Lions is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. SIU-Edwardsville Cougars has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>SIU-Edwardsville Cougars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.27 (ranked #279 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Lindenwood Lions</strong> counter with 102.20 offensive efficiency (#281). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, SIU-Edwardsville Cougars shoot 46.9% on two-pointers, while Lindenwood Lions convert at 51.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. SIU-Edwardsville Cougars's free throw rate sits at 32.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
