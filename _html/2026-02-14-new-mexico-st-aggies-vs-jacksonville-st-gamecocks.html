<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
New Mexico St Aggies (11-13) travels to face Jacksonville St Gamecocks (13-11) at Mathews Coliseum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Jacksonville St Gamecocks favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Jacksonville St Gamecocks's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>New Mexico St Aggies</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.07 (ranked #136 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Jacksonville St Gamecocks</strong> counter with 105.05 offensive efficiency (#239). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
New Mexico St Aggies operate at a 67.1 tempo (#251), while Jacksonville St Gamecocks play at 65.8 (#312). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.5) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, New Mexico St Aggies shoot 49.2% on two-pointers, while Jacksonville St Gamecocks convert at 48.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. New Mexico St Aggies's free throw rate sits at 32.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Jacksonville St Gamecocks check in at 45.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, New Mexico St Aggies convert 73.3% while Jacksonville St Gamecocks hit 68.3%. New Mexico St Aggies's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Jacksonville St Gamecocks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for New Mexico St Aggies. 
From a coaching perspective, Jason Hooten leads New Mexico St Aggies while Ray Harper guides Jacksonville St Gamecocks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
