These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Texas Tech Red Raiders has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Arizona St Sun Devils needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 156.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<strong>Texas Tech Red Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 118.25 (ranked #36 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.9% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Arizona St Sun Devils</strong> counter with 110.54 offensive efficiency (#121). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
