<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Columbia Lions (13-6) hosts Pennsylvania Quakers (9-9) at Levien Gymnasium in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Columbia Lions favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at 151.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Columbia Lions is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Pennsylvania Quakers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Pennsylvania Quakers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.44 (ranked #184 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Columbia Lions</strong> counter with 112.47 offensive efficiency (#105). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.8%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Pennsylvania Quakers operate at a 69.3 tempo (#166), while Columbia Lions play at 68.3 (#216). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.8) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Pennsylvania Quakers shoot 46.3% on two-pointers, while Columbia Lions convert at 54.3%. Columbia Lions has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Pennsylvania Quakers's free throw rate sits at 36.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Columbia Lions check in at 32.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Pennsylvania Quakers convert 69.8% while Columbia Lions hit 75.4%. Columbia Lions's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Columbia Lions get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Pennsylvania Quakers is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Fran McCaffery leads Pennsylvania Quakers while Kevin Hovde guides Columbia Lions. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
