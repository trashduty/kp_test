The early betting action has shaped into Georgetown Hoyas favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Georgetown Hoyas is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Butler Bulldogs has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Butler Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.46 (ranked #109 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Georgetown Hoyas</strong> counter with 110.33 offensive efficiency (#128). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Butler Bulldogs operate at a 69.9 tempo (#116), while Georgetown Hoyas play at 67.3 (#246). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.6) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Butler Bulldogs shoot 51.4% on two-pointers, while Georgetown Hoyas convert at 49.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Butler Bulldogs's free throw rate sits at 42.2, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Georgetown Hoyas check in at 39.8, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Butler Bulldogs convert 70.3% while Georgetown Hoyas hit 74.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Georgetown Hoyas get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor.
