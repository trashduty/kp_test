<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Wofford Terriers (14-7) travels to face Chattanooga Mocs (9-12) at McKenzie Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Chattanooga Mocs favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 150.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Chattanooga Mocs's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Wofford Terriers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.19 (ranked #92 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Chattanooga Mocs</strong> counter with 107.32 offensive efficiency (#189). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Wofford Terriers operate at a 69.0 tempo (#184), while Chattanooga Mocs play at 67.3 (#250). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.2) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Wofford Terriers shoot 50.4% on two-pointers, while Chattanooga Mocs convert at 52.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Wofford Terriers's free throw rate sits at 37.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Chattanooga Mocs check in at 33.3, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wofford Terriers convert 72.6% while Chattanooga Mocs hit 77.9%. Chattanooga Mocs's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Chattanooga Mocs get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Wofford Terriers. 
From a coaching perspective, Kevin Giltner leads Wofford Terriers while Dan Earl guides Chattanooga Mocs. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
