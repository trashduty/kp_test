<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Florida Atlantic Owls (15-13) hosts Temple Owls (15-12) at Baldwin Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Florida Atlantic Owls favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Florida Atlantic Owls is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Temple Owls has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Temple Owls</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.94 (ranked #117 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Florida Atlantic Owls</strong> counter with 109.45 offensive efficiency (#156). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Temple Owls operate at a 65.4 tempo (#325), while Florida Atlantic Owls play at 70.9 (#67). Florida Atlantic Owls like to push the pace, while Temple Owls want to control the clock. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The moderate pace (around 68.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Temple Owls shoot 49.2% on two-pointers, while Florida Atlantic Owls convert at 53.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Temple Owls's free throw rate sits at 41.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Florida Atlantic Owls check in at 32.4, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Temple Owls convert 74.1% while Florida Atlantic Owls hit 70.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
