<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Colgate Raiders (13-10) hosts Army Knights (10-13) at Cotterell Court in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Colgate Raiders favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 149.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Colgate Raiders has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Army Knights needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 149.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Army Knights</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.73 (ranked #243 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Colgate Raiders</strong> counter with 110.11 offensive efficiency (#141). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Army Knights operate at a 67.3 tempo (#248), while Colgate Raiders play at 67.0 (#263). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Army Knights shoot 50.1% on two-pointers, while Colgate Raiders convert at 53.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Army Knights's free throw rate sits at 27.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Colgate Raiders check in at 28.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Army Knights convert 70.5% while Colgate Raiders hit 72.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Colgate Raiders get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Army Knights is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Kevin Kuwik leads Army Knights while Matt Langel guides Colgate Raiders. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Colgate Raiders significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Army Knights will need their best performance to stay competitive.
