<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Lehigh Mountain Hawks (10-13) travels to face Loyola (MD) Greyhounds (8-15) at Reitz Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Loyola (MD) Greyhounds favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Lehigh Mountain Hawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.68 (ranked #291 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Loyola (MD) Greyhounds</strong> counter with 104.83 offensive efficiency (#238). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Lehigh Mountain Hawks operate at a 67.1 tempo (#255), while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds play at 68.8 (#191). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.9) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Lehigh Mountain Hawks shoot 50.6% on two-pointers, while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds convert at 51.5%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Lehigh Mountain Hawks's free throw rate sits at 31.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Loyola (MD) Greyhounds check in at 32.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Lehigh Mountain Hawks convert 73.5% while Loyola (MD) Greyhounds hit 70.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Loyola (MD) Greyhounds get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Lehigh Mountain Hawks. 
From a coaching perspective, Brett Reed leads Lehigh Mountain Hawks while Josh Loeffler guides Loyola (MD) Greyhounds. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
