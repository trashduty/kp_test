<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Tulane Green Wave (16-10) hosts Rice Owls (11-15) at Fogelman Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Tulane Green Wave favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Tulane Green Wave is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Rice Owls has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Rice Owls</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.77 (ranked #213 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tulane Green Wave</strong> counter with 106.12 offensive efficiency (#223). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Rice Owls operate at a 66.7 tempo (#266), while Tulane Green Wave play at 67.9 (#214). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Rice Owls shoot 45.6% on two-pointers, while Tulane Green Wave convert at 51.5%. Tulane Green Wave has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Rice Owls's free throw rate sits at 34.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Tulane Green Wave check in at 44.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Rice Owls convert 68.5% while Tulane Green Wave hit 76.5%. Tulane Green Wave's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Tulane Green Wave get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Rice Owls is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Rob Lanier leads Rice Owls while Ron Hunter guides Tulane Green Wave. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
