These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. South Carolina St Bulldogs's 0.0-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Morgan St Bears</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 99.36 (ranked #322 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>South Carolina St Bulldogs</strong> counter with 93.50 offensive efficiency (#359). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Morgan St Bears's free throw rate sits at 42.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. South Carolina St Bulldogs check in at 39.4, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Morgan St Bears convert 73.5% while South Carolina St Bulldogs hit 63.1%. Morgan St Bears's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>
