These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 18.0-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Gardner-Webb Bulldogs to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires UNC Asheville Bulldogs to play below their standard. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Gardner-Webb Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 91.22 (ranked #363 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>UNC Asheville Bulldogs</strong> counter with 105.25 offensive efficiency (#229). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
