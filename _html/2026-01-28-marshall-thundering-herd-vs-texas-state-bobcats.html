These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Marshall Thundering Herd is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Texas State Bobcats has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Texas State Bobcats</strong> counter with 101.16 offensive efficiency (#295). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.2%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
