These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us North Texas Mean Green has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UTSA Roadrunners needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>North Texas Mean Green</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.50 (ranked #308 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>UTSA Roadrunners</strong> counter with 94.88 offensive efficiency (#349). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. North Texas Mean Green's free throw rate sits at 38.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. UTSA Roadrunners check in at 30.3, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, North Texas Mean Green convert 69.7% while UTSA Roadrunners hit 69.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
