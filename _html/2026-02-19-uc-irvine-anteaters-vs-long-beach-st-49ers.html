These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates UC Irvine Anteaters is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Long Beach St 49ers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UC Irvine Anteaters</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.95 (ranked #283 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Long Beach St 49ers</strong> counter with 102.07 offensive efficiency (#295). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
