<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Creighton Bluejays (13-11) travels to face DePaul Blue Demons (12-12) at Wintrust Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into DePaul Blue Demons favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. DePaul Blue Demons's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Creighton Bluejays</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 111.31 (ranked #110 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>DePaul Blue Demons</strong> counter with 104.88 offensive efficiency (#240). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Creighton Bluejays operate at a 68.3 tempo (#202), while DePaul Blue Demons play at 68.3 (#210). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Creighton Bluejays shoot 57.1% on two-pointers, while DePaul Blue Demons convert at 51.1%. Creighton Bluejays has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Creighton Bluejays's free throw rate sits at 27.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. DePaul Blue Demons check in at 36.8, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Creighton Bluejays convert 75.1% while DePaul Blue Demons hit 69.7%. Creighton Bluejays's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, DePaul Blue Demons get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Creighton Bluejays. 
From a coaching perspective, Greg McDermott leads Creighton Bluejays while Chris Holtmann guides DePaul Blue Demons. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
