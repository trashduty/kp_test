These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.0 points tells us Iowa State Cyclones has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Texas Tech Red Raiders needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

<strong>Texas Tech Red Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 119.07 (ranked #30 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Iowa State Cyclones</strong> counter with 120.70 offensive efficiency (#17). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 39.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

</p>
