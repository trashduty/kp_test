These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Youngstown St Penguins is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Northern Kentucky Norse has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.
