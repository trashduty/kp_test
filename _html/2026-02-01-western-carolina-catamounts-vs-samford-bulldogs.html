These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Western Carolina Catamounts's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Western Carolina Catamounts</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.17 (ranked #194 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Samford Bulldogs</strong> counter with 109.68 offensive efficiency (#149). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 32.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Western Carolina Catamounts's free throw rate sits at 30.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Samford Bulldogs check in at 41.1, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Western Carolina Catamounts convert 68.9% while Samford Bulldogs hit 67.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
