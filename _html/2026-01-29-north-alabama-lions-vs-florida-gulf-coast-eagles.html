<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Florida Gulf Coast Eagles (8-13) hosts North Alabama Lions (6-12) at Alico Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Florida Gulf Coast Eagles favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 150.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Florida Gulf Coast Eagles has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. North Alabama Lions needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>North Alabama Lions</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.10 (ranked #263 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Florida Gulf Coast Eagles</strong> counter with 110.70 offensive efficiency (#126). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
North Alabama Lions operate at a 66.3 tempo (#303), while Florida Gulf Coast Eagles play at 70.4 (#104). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.4) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, North Alabama Lions shoot 47.9% on two-pointers, while Florida Gulf Coast Eagles convert at 52.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. North Alabama Lions's free throw rate sits at 37.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles check in at 30.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, North Alabama Lions convert 68.6% while Florida Gulf Coast Eagles hit 74.1%. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—North Alabama Lions is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Tony Pujol leads North Alabama Lions while Pat Chambers guides Florida Gulf Coast Eagles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
