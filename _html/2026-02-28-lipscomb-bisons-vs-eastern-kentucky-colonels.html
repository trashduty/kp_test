Lipscomb Bisons (18-12) travels to face Eastern Kentucky Colonels (11-19) at Baptist Health Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Lipscomb Bisons favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 159.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Lipscomb Bisons's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 159.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Lipscomb Bisons</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.64 (ranked #122 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Eastern Kentucky Colonels</strong> counter with 110.99 offensive efficiency (#114). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Lipscomb Bisons's free throw rate sits at 26.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Eastern Kentucky Colonels check in at 31.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Lipscomb Bisons convert 75.7% while Eastern Kentucky Colonels hit 72.0%.
