<strong>Evansville Purple Aces</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 95.44 (ranked #353 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Murray St Racers</strong> counter with 115.49 offensive efficiency (#60). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
