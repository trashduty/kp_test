These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Ohio State Buckeyes has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. USC Trojans needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>USC Trojans</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.33 (ranked #129 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 32.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
