<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Columbia Lions (15-9) hosts Dartmouth Big Green (10-13) at Levien Gymnasium in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Columbia Lions favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Columbia Lions is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Dartmouth Big Green has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Dartmouth Big Green</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.85 (ranked #227 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Columbia Lions</strong> counter with 111.79 offensive efficiency (#104). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Dartmouth Big Green operate at a 69.0 tempo (#152), while Columbia Lions play at 67.4 (#236). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.2) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Dartmouth Big Green shoot 49.5% on two-pointers, while Columbia Lions convert at 54.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Dartmouth Big Green's free throw rate sits at 36.5, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Columbia Lions check in at 30.8, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Dartmouth Big Green convert 73.0% while Columbia Lions hit 70.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Columbia Lions get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Dartmouth Big Green is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Dave McLaughlin leads Dartmouth Big Green while Kevin Hovde guides Columbia Lions. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Columbia Lions significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Dartmouth Big Green will need their best performance to stay competitive.
