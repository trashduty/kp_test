<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Colgate Raiders (14-10) travels to face Bucknell Bison (8-16) at Sojka Pavilion in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Colgate Raiders favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Colgate Raiders is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Bucknell Bison has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Colgate Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.98 (ranked #145 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Bucknell Bison</strong> counter with 99.98 offensive efficiency (#314). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Colgate Raiders operate at a 66.9 tempo (#262), while Bucknell Bison play at 66.7 (#272). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Colgate Raiders shoot 53.8% on two-pointers, while Bucknell Bison convert at 49.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Colgate Raiders's free throw rate sits at 28.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Bucknell Bison check in at 32.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Colgate Raiders convert 72.8% while Bucknell Bison hit 77.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Bucknell Bison get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Colgate Raiders. 
From a coaching perspective, Matt Langel leads Colgate Raiders while John Griffin guides Bucknell Bison. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
