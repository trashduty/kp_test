<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Missouri St Bears (13-11) hosts Delaware Blue Hens (8-16) at Great Southern Bank Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Missouri St Bears favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 134.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Missouri St Bears has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Delaware Blue Hens needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 134.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Delaware Blue Hens</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.79 (ranked #285 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Missouri St Bears</strong> counter with 106.61 offensive efficiency (#208). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.6%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Delaware Blue Hens operate at a 63.9 tempo (#358), while Missouri St Bears play at 66.7 (#273). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Delaware Blue Hens shoot 51.7% on two-pointers, while Missouri St Bears convert at 52.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Delaware Blue Hens's free throw rate sits at 28.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Missouri St Bears check in at 44.8, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Delaware Blue Hens convert 75.7% while Missouri St Bears hit 66.7%. Delaware Blue Hens's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Missouri St Bears get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Delaware Blue Hens is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Martin Ingelsby leads Delaware Blue Hens while Cuonzo Martin guides Missouri St Bears. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Missouri St Bears significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Delaware Blue Hens will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
Both teams are fairly evenly matched on both ends of the floor. This could come down to execution in crunch time. 
</p>

<h2>Delaware Blue Hens</h2>
