<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>

</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 96.88 (ranked #346 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans</strong> counter with 101.82 offensive efficiency (#298). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles's free throw rate sits at 37.2, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans check in at 27.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles convert 66.1% while Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans hit 68.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
