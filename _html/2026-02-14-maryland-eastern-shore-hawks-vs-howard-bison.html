<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Howard Bison (15-10) hosts Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks (8-17) at Burr Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Howard Bison favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 129.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Howard Bison has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 129.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 93.89 (ranked #357 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Howard Bison</strong> counter with 103.05 offensive efficiency (#277). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks operate at a 64.7 tempo (#340), while Howard Bison play at 69.1 (#163). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.9) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks shoot 49.5% on two-pointers, while Howard Bison convert at 47.5%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks's free throw rate sits at 28.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Howard Bison check in at 42.2, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks convert 71.1% while Howard Bison hit 73.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Howard Bison get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Cleo Hill leads Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks while Kenny Blakeney guides Howard Bison. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
