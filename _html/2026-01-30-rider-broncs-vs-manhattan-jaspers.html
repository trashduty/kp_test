<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Manhattan Jaspers (8-14) hosts Rider Broncs (2-17) at Draddy Gymnasium in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Manhattan Jaspers favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Manhattan Jaspers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Rider Broncs has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Rider Broncs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 92.94 (ranked #356 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 26.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Manhattan Jaspers</strong> counter with 103.50 offensive efficiency (#260). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Rider Broncs operate at a 65.9 tempo (#314), while Manhattan Jaspers play at 69.0 (#184). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.4) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Rider Broncs shoot 42.6% on two-pointers, while Manhattan Jaspers convert at 46.9%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Rider Broncs's free throw rate sits at 30.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Manhattan Jaspers check in at 33.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Rider Broncs convert 70.6% while Manhattan Jaspers hit 78.8%. Manhattan Jaspers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Manhattan Jaspers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Kevin Baggett leads Rider Broncs while John Gallagher guides Manhattan Jaspers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
