<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When Purdue Boilermakers (19-4) travels to face Nebraska Cornhuskers (21-2) at Pinnacle Bank Arena, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Nebraska Cornhuskers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Nebraska Cornhuskers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Purdue Boilermakers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 124.00 (ranked #2 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Nebraska Cornhuskers</strong> counter with 117.15 offensive efficiency (#50). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Purdue Boilermakers operate at a 66.8 tempo (#269), while Nebraska Cornhuskers play at 68.3 (#204). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Purdue Boilermakers shoot 59.1% on two-pointers, while Nebraska Cornhuskers convert at 59.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Purdue Boilermakers's free throw rate sits at 28.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Nebraska Cornhuskers check in at 26.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Purdue Boilermakers convert 74.6% while Nebraska Cornhuskers hit 76.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Nebraska Cornhuskers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Matt Painter leads Purdue Boilermakers while Fred Hoiberg guides Nebraska Cornhuskers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
