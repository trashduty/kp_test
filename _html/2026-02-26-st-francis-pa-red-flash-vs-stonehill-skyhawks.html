These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Stonehill Skyhawks is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. St. Francis (PA) Red Flash has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>St. Francis (PA) Red Flash</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 99.60 (ranked #328 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Stonehill Skyhawks</strong> counter with 92.99 offensive efficiency (#361). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
