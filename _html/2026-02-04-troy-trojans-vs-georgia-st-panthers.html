These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Troy Trojans is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Georgia St Panthers has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.
