These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Howard Bison has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Morgan St Bears needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Howard Bison</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.40 (ranked #220 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Morgan St Bears</strong> counter with 101.15 offensive efficiency (#307). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
