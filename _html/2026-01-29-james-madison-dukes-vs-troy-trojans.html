<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Troy Trojans (15-6) hosts James Madison Dukes (10-11) at Trojan Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Troy Trojans has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. James Madison Dukes needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<strong>James Madison Dukes</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.74 (ranked #125 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.6% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Troy Trojans</strong> counter with 114.42 offensive efficiency (#76). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
