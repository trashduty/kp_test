These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Saint Louis Billikens has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Davidson Wildcats needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Davidson Wildcats</strong> counter with 108.88 offensive efficiency (#169). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
