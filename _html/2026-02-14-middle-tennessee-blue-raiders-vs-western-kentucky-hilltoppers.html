These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Western Kentucky Hilltoppers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge.

</p>

<strong>Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.57 (ranked #209 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Western Kentucky Hilltoppers</strong> counter with 105.52 offensive efficiency (#232). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.6%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Western Kentucky Hilltoppers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>
