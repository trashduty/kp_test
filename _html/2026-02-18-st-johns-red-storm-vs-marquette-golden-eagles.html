These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us St. John's Red Storm has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Marquette Golden Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>St. John's Red Storm</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 116.59 (ranked #52 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Marquette Golden Eagles</strong> counter with 106.52 offensive efficiency (#211). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
