</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>

</p>

<strong>North Texas Mean Green</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.68 (ranked #298 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tulsa Golden Hurricane</strong> counter with 124.89 offensive efficiency (#3). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 41.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

</p>
