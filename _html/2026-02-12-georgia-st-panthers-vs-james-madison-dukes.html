</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Georgia St Panthers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 99.33 (ranked #321 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.8% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>James Madison Dukes</strong> counter with 110.04 offensive efficiency (#136). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

</p>
