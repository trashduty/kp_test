<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Missouri Tigers (14-7) hosts Mississippi St Bulldogs (11-10) at Mizzou Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Missouri Tigers favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Missouri Tigers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Mississippi St Bulldogs needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Mississippi St Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.49 (ranked #183 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Missouri Tigers</strong> counter with 115.65 offensive efficiency (#64). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Mississippi St Bulldogs operate at a 71.1 tempo (#78), while Missouri Tigers play at 68.8 (#196). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.0) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Mississippi St Bulldogs shoot 53.3% on two-pointers, while Missouri Tigers convert at 58.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Mississippi St Bulldogs's free throw rate sits at 32.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Missouri Tigers check in at 40.8, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Mississippi St Bulldogs convert 68.8% while Missouri Tigers hit 66.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Missouri Tigers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Jans leads Mississippi St Bulldogs while Dennis Gates guides Missouri Tigers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
