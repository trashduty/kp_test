<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Green Bay Phoenix (16-13) travels to face Detroit Mercy Titans (13-13) at Calihan Hall in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Detroit Mercy Titans favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Detroit Mercy Titans's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Green Bay Phoenix</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.54 (ranked #83 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.9% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Detroit Mercy Titans</strong> counter with 109.10 offensive efficiency (#164). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Green Bay Phoenix's free throw rate sits at 42.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Detroit Mercy Titans check in at 31.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Green Bay Phoenix convert 76.4% while Detroit Mercy Titans hit 77.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
