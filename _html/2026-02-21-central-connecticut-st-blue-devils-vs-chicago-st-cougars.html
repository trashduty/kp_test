</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Central Connecticut St Blue Devils is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Central Connecticut St Blue Devils</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.84 (ranked #169 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.6% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Chicago St Cougars</strong> counter with 98.47 offensive efficiency (#336). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Central Connecticut St Blue Devils's free throw rate sits at 31.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Chicago St Cougars check in at 30.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Central Connecticut St Blue Devils convert 76.9% while Chicago St Cougars hit 75.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
