<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Notre Dame Fighting Irish (12-14) travels to face Pittsburgh Panthers (9-17) at Petersen Events Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Pittsburgh Panthers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 138.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Pittsburgh Panthers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 138.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Notre Dame Fighting Irish</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.14 (ranked #138 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.3% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Pittsburgh Panthers</strong> counter with 106.72 offensive efficiency (#209). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Notre Dame Fighting Irish operate at a 66.6 tempo (#277), while Pittsburgh Panthers play at 64.9 (#334). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Notre Dame Fighting Irish shoot 51.5% on two-pointers, while Pittsburgh Panthers convert at 51.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Notre Dame Fighting Irish's free throw rate sits at 33.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Pittsburgh Panthers check in at 29.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Notre Dame Fighting Irish convert 69.2% while Pittsburgh Panthers hit 66.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Pittsburgh Panthers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 
From a coaching perspective, Micah Shrewsberry leads Notre Dame Fighting Irish while Jeff Capel III guides Pittsburgh Panthers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
