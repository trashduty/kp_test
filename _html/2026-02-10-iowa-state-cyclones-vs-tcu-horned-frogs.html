These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Iowa State Cyclones is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. TCU Horned Frogs has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 40.7% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>TCU Horned Frogs</strong> counter with 111.02 offensive efficiency (#117). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
