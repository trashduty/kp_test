These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Monmouth Hawks is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Elon Phoenix has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Elon Phoenix</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.53 (ranked #82 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Monmouth Hawks</strong> counter with 104.54 offensive efficiency (#258). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Elon Phoenix operate at a 68.2 tempo (#199), while Monmouth Hawks play at 67.5 (#230). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Elon Phoenix's free throw rate sits at 33.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Monmouth Hawks check in at 32.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Elon Phoenix convert 70.5% while Monmouth Hawks hit 74.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
