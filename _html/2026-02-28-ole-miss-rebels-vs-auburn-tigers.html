<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Auburn Tigers (15-13) hosts Ole Miss Rebels (11-17) at Neville Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Auburn Tigers favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at 153.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Auburn Tigers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Ole Miss Rebels needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Ole Miss Rebels</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.11 (ranked #162 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Auburn Tigers</strong> counter with 119.10 offensive efficiency (#29). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 33.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Ole Miss Rebels operate at a 67.9 tempo (#211), while Auburn Tigers play at 69.4 (#131). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.7) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Ole Miss Rebels shoot 50.2% on two-pointers, while Auburn Tigers convert at 53.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Ole Miss Rebels's free throw rate sits at 33.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Auburn Tigers check in at 45.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Ole Miss Rebels convert 74.6% while Auburn Tigers hit 74.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Auburn Tigers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Ole Miss Rebels is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Beard leads Ole Miss Rebels while Steven Pearl guides Auburn Tigers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
Auburn Tigers's offense (#29) could exploit Ole Miss Rebels's defensive vulnerabilities (#223).
