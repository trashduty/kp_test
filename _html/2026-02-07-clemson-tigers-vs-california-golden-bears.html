These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
The 3.0-point spread indicates Clemson Tigers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. California Golden Bears has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
