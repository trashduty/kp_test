These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Alabama St Hornets's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 150.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<strong>Arkansas-Pine Bluff Golden Lions</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.88 (ranked #283 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Alabama St Hornets</strong> counter with 98.97 offensive efficiency (#326). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
