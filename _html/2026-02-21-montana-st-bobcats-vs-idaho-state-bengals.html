<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Montana St Bobcats (15-12) travels to face Idaho State Bengals (11-17) at Reed Gym in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Montana St Bobcats favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Montana St Bobcats's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Montana St Bobcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.33 (ranked #135 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Idaho State Bengals</strong> counter with 109.52 offensive efficiency (#150). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Montana St Bobcats operate at a 67.3 tempo (#243), while Idaho State Bengals play at 66.4 (#283). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.9) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Montana St Bobcats shoot 52.8% on two-pointers, while Idaho State Bengals convert at 52.9%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Montana St Bobcats's free throw rate sits at 31.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Idaho State Bengals check in at 38.3, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Montana St Bobcats convert 75.5% while Idaho State Bengals hit 75.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Idaho State Bengals get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Montana St Bobcats. 
From a coaching perspective, Matt Logie leads Montana St Bobcats while Ryan Looney guides Idaho State Bengals. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
