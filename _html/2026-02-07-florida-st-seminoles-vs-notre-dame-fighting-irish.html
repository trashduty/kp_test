<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Notre Dame Fighting Irish (11-12) hosts Florida St Seminoles (10-12) at Joyce Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Notre Dame Fighting Irish favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 153.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Notre Dame Fighting Irish's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Florida St Seminoles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.34 (ranked #157 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Notre Dame Fighting Irish</strong> counter with 109.05 offensive efficiency (#160). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>
