The early betting action has shaped into East Tennessee St Buccaneers favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 152.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us East Tennessee St Buccaneers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Wofford Terriers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Wofford Terriers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.91 (ranked #79 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>East Tennessee St Buccaneers</strong> counter with 115.40 offensive efficiency (#63). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>
