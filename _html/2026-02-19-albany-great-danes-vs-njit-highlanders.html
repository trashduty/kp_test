<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders (15-12) hosts Albany Great Danes (9-17) at Wellness and Events Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into NJIT Highlanders favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates NJIT Highlanders is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Albany Great Danes has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Albany Great Danes</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.44 (ranked #276 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>NJIT Highlanders</strong> counter with 99.43 offensive efficiency (#325). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Albany Great Danes operate at a 66.5 tempo (#286), while NJIT Highlanders play at 68.7 (#175). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Albany Great Danes shoot 52.2% on two-pointers, while NJIT Highlanders convert at 48.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Albany Great Danes's free throw rate sits at 27.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. NJIT Highlanders check in at 34.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Albany Great Danes convert 65.6% while NJIT Highlanders hit 70.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, NJIT Highlanders get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Albany Great Danes is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Dwayne Killings leads Albany Great Danes while Grant Billmeier guides NJIT Highlanders. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
