The early betting action has shaped into Lipscomb Bisons favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 168.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Lipscomb Bisons has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. North Florida Ospreys needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 168.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Lipscomb Bisons</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.34 (ranked #156 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>North Florida Ospreys</strong> counter with 106.65 offensive efficiency (#203). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Lipscomb Bisons's free throw rate sits at 27.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. North Florida Ospreys check in at 25.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Lipscomb Bisons convert 76.1% while North Florida Ospreys hit 79.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
