<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Dayton Flyers (14-8) hosts St. Bonaventure Bonnies (13-9) at University of Dayton Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Dayton Flyers favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 146.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Dayton Flyers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. St. Bonaventure Bonnies needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 146.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>St. Bonaventure Bonnies</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 112.85 (ranked #92 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Dayton Flyers</strong> counter with 108.91 offensive efficiency (#166). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
St. Bonaventure Bonnies operate at a 68.0 tempo (#224), while Dayton Flyers play at 69.2 (#156). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.6) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, St. Bonaventure Bonnies shoot 50.6% on two-pointers, while Dayton Flyers convert at 54.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. St. Bonaventure Bonnies's free throw rate sits at 29.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Dayton Flyers check in at 46.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, St. Bonaventure Bonnies convert 75.9% while Dayton Flyers hit 75.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Dayton Flyers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—St. Bonaventure Bonnies is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Mark Schmidt leads St. Bonaventure Bonnies while Anthony Grant guides Dayton Flyers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
