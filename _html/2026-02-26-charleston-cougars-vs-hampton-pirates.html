<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Charleston Cougars (19-10) enters hostile territory as they take on Hampton Pirates (12-16) at Hampton Convocation Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Charleston Cougars favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Charleston Cougars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Hampton Pirates has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Charleston Cougars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.81 (ranked #167 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Hampton Pirates</strong> counter with 100.73 offensive efficiency (#310). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Charleston Cougars operate at a 68.7 tempo (#171), while Hampton Pirates play at 65.6 (#316). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Charleston Cougars shoot 53.5% on two-pointers, while Hampton Pirates convert at 46.3%. Charleston Cougars has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Charleston Cougars's free throw rate sits at 40.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Hampton Pirates check in at 39.3, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Charleston Cougars convert 74.3% while Hampton Pirates hit 72.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Hampton Pirates get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Charleston Cougars. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Mack leads Charleston Cougars while Ivan Thomas guides Hampton Pirates. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
