</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates South Dakota St Jackrabbits is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge.

<strong>South Dakota St Jackrabbits</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.70 (ranked #185 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Oral Roberts Golden Eagles</strong> counter with 99.86 offensive efficiency (#317). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
