<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Iona Gaels (14-11) travels to face Canisius Golden Griffins (8-17) at Koessler Athletic Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Iona Gaels favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Iona Gaels is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Canisius Golden Griffins has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Iona Gaels</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.51 (ranked #231 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Canisius Golden Griffins</strong> counter with 95.99 offensive efficiency (#347). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Iona Gaels operate at a 69.2 tempo (#154), while Canisius Golden Griffins play at 64.3 (#350). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Iona Gaels shoot 50.7% on two-pointers, while Canisius Golden Griffins convert at 43.1%. Iona Gaels has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Iona Gaels's free throw rate sits at 27.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Canisius Golden Griffins check in at 31.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Iona Gaels convert 69.6% while Canisius Golden Griffins hit 69.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Canisius Golden Griffins get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Iona Gaels. 
From a coaching perspective, Dan Geriot leads Iona Gaels while Jim Christian guides Canisius Golden Griffins. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
