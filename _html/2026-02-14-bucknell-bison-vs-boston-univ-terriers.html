<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Boston Univ. Terriers (11-15) hosts Bucknell Bison (8-18) at Case Gym in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Boston Univ. Terriers favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 141.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Boston Univ. Terriers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Bucknell Bison has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Bucknell Bison</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 98.72 (ranked #330 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.6% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Boston Univ. Terriers</strong> counter with 112.79 offensive efficiency (#87). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Bucknell Bison operate at a 67.1 tempo (#253), while Boston Univ. Terriers play at 64.1 (#354). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.6) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Bucknell Bison shoot 49.3% on two-pointers, while Boston Univ. Terriers convert at 56.6%. Boston Univ. Terriers has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Bucknell Bison's free throw rate sits at 31.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Boston Univ. Terriers check in at 33.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Bucknell Bison convert 77.5% while Boston Univ. Terriers hit 71.5%. Bucknell Bison's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Boston Univ. Terriers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Bucknell Bison is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, John Griffin leads Bucknell Bison while Joe Jones guides Boston Univ. Terriers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
