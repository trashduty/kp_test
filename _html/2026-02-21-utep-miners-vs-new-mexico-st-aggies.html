<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
New Mexico St Aggies (12-13) hosts UTEP Miners (10-16) at Pan American Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into New Mexico St Aggies favored by 6.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates New Mexico St Aggies is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. UTEP Miners has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UTEP Miners</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.11 (ranked #320 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>New Mexico St Aggies</strong> counter with 110.52 offensive efficiency (#128). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
UTEP Miners operate at a 65.5 tempo (#322), while New Mexico St Aggies play at 67.1 (#253). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, UTEP Miners shoot 46.2% on two-pointers, while New Mexico St Aggies convert at 49.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. UTEP Miners's free throw rate sits at 31.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. New Mexico St Aggies check in at 33.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, UTEP Miners convert 70.0% while New Mexico St Aggies hit 74.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, New Mexico St Aggies get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—UTEP Miners is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Joe Golding leads UTEP Miners while Jason Hooten guides New Mexico St Aggies. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
