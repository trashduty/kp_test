<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Radford Highlanders (14-13) hosts Gardner-Webb Bulldogs (3-25) at Dedmon Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Radford Highlanders favored by 19.5 points, with the total sitting at 161.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 19.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Gardner-Webb Bulldogs to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Radford Highlanders to play below their standard. The total of 161.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Gardner-Webb Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 92.76 (ranked #361 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Radford Highlanders</strong> counter with 109.38 offensive efficiency (#156). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>
