These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us UC San Diego Tritons has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UC Riverside Highlanders needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UC Riverside Highlanders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.14 (ranked #314 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>UC San Diego Tritons</strong> counter with 107.35 offensive efficiency (#190). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
