<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>

The early betting action has shaped into Quinnipiac Bobcats favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 151.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Quinnipiac Bobcats's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Quinnipiac Bobcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.68 (ranked #202 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Fairfield Stags</strong> counter with 109.82 offensive efficiency (#144). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>
