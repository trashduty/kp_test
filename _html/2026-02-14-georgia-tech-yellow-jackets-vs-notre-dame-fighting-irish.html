These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Notre Dame Fighting Irish has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.47 (ranked #269 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.8% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Notre Dame Fighting Irish</strong> counter with 109.37 offensive efficiency (#158). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
