These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Xavier Musketeers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Georgetown Hoyas has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Xavier Musketeers</strong> counter with 108.37 offensive efficiency (#178). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
