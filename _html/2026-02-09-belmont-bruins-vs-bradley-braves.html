<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Belmont Bruins (22-3) travels to face Bradley Braves (16-9) at Carver Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Belmont Bruins favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 154.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Belmont Bruins's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Belmont Bruins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 118.04 (ranked #40 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 41.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Bradley Braves</strong> counter with 109.24 offensive efficiency (#157). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Belmont Bruins operate at a 70.1 tempo (#114), while Bradley Braves play at 68.2 (#213). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.2) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Belmont Bruins shoot 60.7% on two-pointers, while Bradley Braves convert at 48.5%. Belmont Bruins has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Belmont Bruins's free throw rate sits at 33.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Bradley Braves check in at 35.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Belmont Bruins convert 66.7% while Bradley Braves hit 74.5%. Bradley Braves's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Bradley Braves get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Belmont Bruins. 
From a coaching perspective, Casey Alexander leads Belmont Bruins while Brian Wardle guides Bradley Braves. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
