These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Eastern Kentucky Colonels's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

<strong>Austin Peay Governors</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.38 (ranked #189 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Eastern Kentucky Colonels</strong> counter with 109.44 offensive efficiency (#153). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
