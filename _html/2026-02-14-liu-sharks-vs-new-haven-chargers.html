<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
LIU Sharks (17-8) enters hostile territory as they take on New Haven Chargers (10-15) at The Hazell Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into LIU Sharks favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us LIU Sharks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. New Haven Chargers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>LIU Sharks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.30 (ranked #218 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>New Haven Chargers</strong> counter with 94.82 offensive efficiency (#351). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
LIU Sharks operate at a 69.0 tempo (#170), while New Haven Chargers play at 63.4 (#363). LIU Sharks want to run, but New Haven Chargers prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 66.2) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, LIU Sharks shoot 51.4% on two-pointers, while New Haven Chargers convert at 50.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. LIU Sharks's free throw rate sits at 33.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. New Haven Chargers check in at 29.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, LIU Sharks convert 65.4% while New Haven Chargers hit 70.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, New Haven Chargers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for LIU Sharks. 
From a coaching perspective, Rod Strickland leads LIU Sharks while Ted Hotaling guides New Haven Chargers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
Both teams are fairly evenly matched on both ends of the floor. This could come down to execution in crunch time.
