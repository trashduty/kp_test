  <h3>Betting Lines</h3>

</div>

<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<p>
#### Setting the Stage
Dayton Flyers (14-6) hosts Rhode Island Rams (12-8) at University of Dayton Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Dayton Flyers favored by 8.0 points, with the total sitting at 135.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread around 8.0 points tells us Dayton Flyers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Rhode Island Rams needs to punch above their weight class to keep this competitive. The total of 135.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<p>
#### Offensive Firepower
</p>
<strong>Rhode Island Rams</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.42 (ranked #155 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Dayton Flyers</strong> counter with 109.85 offensive efficiency (#142). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 32.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<p>
#### Tempo & Playing Style
Rhode Island Rams operate at a 65.9 tempo (#316), while Dayton Flyers play at 69.2 (#175). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.5) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<p>
#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Rhode Island Rams shoot 57.3% on two-pointers, while Dayton Flyers convert at 54.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Rhode Island Rams's free throw rate sits at 37.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Dayton Flyers check in at 46.2, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Rhode Island Rams convert 72.5% while Dayton Flyers hit 75.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<p>
#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Dayton Flyers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Rhode Island Rams is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Archie Miller leads Rhode Island Rams while Anthony Grant guides Dayton Flyers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
