<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Eastern Washington Eagles (5-15) travels to face Northern Arizona Lumberjacks (7-14) at Walkup Skydome in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Eastern Washington Eagles favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Eastern Washington Eagles's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Eastern Washington Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.42 (ranked #205 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Northern Arizona Lumberjacks</strong> counter with 101.82 offensive efficiency (#285). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Eastern Washington Eagles operate at a 69.8 tempo (#133), while Northern Arizona Lumberjacks play at 66.6 (#283). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.2) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Eastern Washington Eagles shoot 50.8% on two-pointers, while Northern Arizona Lumberjacks convert at 49.9%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Eastern Washington Eagles's free throw rate sits at 33.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Northern Arizona Lumberjacks check in at 29.8, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Eastern Washington Eagles convert 74.4% while Northern Arizona Lumberjacks hit 67.1%. Eastern Washington Eagles's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Northern Arizona Lumberjacks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Eastern Washington Eagles. 
From a coaching perspective, Dan Monson leads Eastern Washington Eagles while Shane Burcar guides Northern Arizona Lumberjacks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
