<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Niagara Purple Eagles (7-20) travels to face Rider Broncs (3-23) at Alumni Gymnasium in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Niagara Purple Eagles favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Niagara Purple Eagles's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Niagara Purple Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 99.48 (ranked #327 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Rider Broncs</strong> counter with 95.67 offensive efficiency (#352). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Niagara Purple Eagles operate at a 63.2 tempo (#365), while Rider Broncs play at 65.5 (#322). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 64.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Niagara Purple Eagles shoot 49.7% on two-pointers, while Rider Broncs convert at 43.2%. Niagara Purple Eagles has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Niagara Purple Eagles's free throw rate sits at 26.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Rider Broncs check in at 30.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Niagara Purple Eagles convert 72.0% while Rider Broncs hit 69.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Rider Broncs get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Greg Paulus leads Niagara Purple Eagles while Kevin Baggett guides Rider Broncs. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, Niagara Purple Eagles holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but Rider Broncs could make this interesting if they play to their potential. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
