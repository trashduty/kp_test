<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Nevada Wolf Pack (16-7) hosts Fresno St Bulldogs (11-11) at Lawlor Events Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Nevada Wolf Pack favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Nevada Wolf Pack has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Fresno St Bulldogs needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Fresno St Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.19 (ranked #269 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Nevada Wolf Pack</strong> counter with 115.38 offensive efficiency (#68). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 39.4%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

Fresno St Bulldogs operate at a 70.5 tempo (#95), while Nevada Wolf Pack play at 66.2 (#294). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.4) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Fresno St Bulldogs's free throw rate sits at 36.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Nevada Wolf Pack check in at 44.4, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Fresno St Bulldogs convert 75.5% while Nevada Wolf Pack hit 75.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
