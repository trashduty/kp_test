<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Tenn-Martin Skyhawks (20-8) travels to face Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans (10-17) at Stephens Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Tenn-Martin Skyhawks favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 133.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Tenn-Martin Skyhawks's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 133.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Tenn-Martin Skyhawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.50 (ranked #258 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans</strong> counter with 101.40 offensive efficiency (#304). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<p>
Tenn-Martin Skyhawks operate at a 66.6 tempo (#279), while Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans play at 67.6 (#227). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Tenn-Martin Skyhawks's free throw rate sits at 40.9, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans check in at 27.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Tenn-Martin Skyhawks convert 67.0% while Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans hit 68.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
