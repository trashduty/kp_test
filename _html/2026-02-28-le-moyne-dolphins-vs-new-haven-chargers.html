These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Le Moyne Dolphins's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

<strong>Le Moyne Dolphins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.67 (ranked #236 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>New Haven Chargers</strong> counter with 96.76 offensive efficiency (#348). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.3%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
