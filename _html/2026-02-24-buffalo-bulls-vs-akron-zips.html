The early betting action has shaped into Akron Zips favored by 15.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 15.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Buffalo Bulls to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Akron Zips to play below their standard.

<strong>Buffalo Bulls</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 114.75 (ranked #72 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.6% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
