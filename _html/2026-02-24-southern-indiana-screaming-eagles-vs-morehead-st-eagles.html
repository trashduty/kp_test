These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Morehead St Eagles has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 96.60 (ranked #346 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Morehead St Eagles</strong> counter with 107.30 offensive efficiency (#198). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Morehead St Eagles's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>
