<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders (13-14) hosts UTEP Miners (10-17) at Murphy Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UTEP Miners needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UTEP Miners</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.44 (ranked #316 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders</strong> counter with 107.40 offensive efficiency (#195). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
UTEP Miners operate at a 65.2 tempo (#330), while Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders play at 66.4 (#282). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, UTEP Miners shoot 46.3% on two-pointers, while Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders convert at 52.5%. Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. UTEP Miners's free throw rate sits at 31.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders check in at 30.8, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, UTEP Miners convert 70.4% while Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders hit 68.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—UTEP Miners is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Joe Golding leads UTEP Miners while Nicholas McDevitt guides Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. UTEP Miners will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
