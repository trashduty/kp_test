<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When Wagner Seahawks (8-15) travels to face Stonehill Skyhawks (9-17) at Merkert Gymnasium, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Stonehill Skyhawks favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Stonehill Skyhawks is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Wagner Seahawks has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Wagner Seahawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.78 (ranked #244 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Stonehill Skyhawks</strong> counter with 93.21 offensive efficiency (#360). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.6%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Wagner Seahawks operate at a 65.5 tempo (#324), while Stonehill Skyhawks play at 66.0 (#304). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Wagner Seahawks shoot 47.4% on two-pointers, while Stonehill Skyhawks convert at 46.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Wagner Seahawks's free throw rate sits at 31.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Stonehill Skyhawks check in at 26.3, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wagner Seahawks convert 69.7% while Stonehill Skyhawks hit 68.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Stonehill Skyhawks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Dwan McMillan leads Wagner Seahawks while Chris Kraus guides Stonehill Skyhawks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
