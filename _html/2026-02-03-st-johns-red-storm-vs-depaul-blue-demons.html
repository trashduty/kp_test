<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
St. John's Red Storm (16-5) enters hostile territory as they take on DePaul Blue Demons (12-10) at Wintrust Arena in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into St. John's Red Storm favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us St. John's Red Storm has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. DePaul Blue Demons needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>St. John's Red Storm</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 118.28 (ranked #39 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>DePaul Blue Demons</strong> counter with 105.96 offensive efficiency (#221). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

DePaul Blue Demons check in at 38.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, St. John's Red Storm convert 73.2% while DePaul Blue Demons hit 69.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
