<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Stanford Cardinal (14-7) travels to face Florida St Seminoles (9-12) at Donald L. Tucker Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Florida St Seminoles favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Florida St Seminoles's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Stanford Cardinal</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.81 (ranked #165 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Florida St Seminoles</strong> counter with 108.48 offensive efficiency (#171). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.2%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Stanford Cardinal operate at a 69.2 tempo (#169), while Florida St Seminoles play at 74.2 (#11). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.7) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Stanford Cardinal shoot 48.6% on two-pointers, while Florida St Seminoles convert at 53.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Stanford Cardinal's free throw rate sits at 40.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Florida St Seminoles check in at 33.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Stanford Cardinal convert 72.0% while Florida St Seminoles hit 70.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Florida St Seminoles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Stanford Cardinal. 
From a coaching perspective, Kyle Smith leads Stanford Cardinal while Luke Loucks guides Florida St Seminoles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
