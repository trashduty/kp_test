These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Arizona St Sun Devils's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 164.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>
