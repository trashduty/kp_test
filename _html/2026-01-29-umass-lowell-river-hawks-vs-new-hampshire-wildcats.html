These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.0-point spread indicates New Hampshire Wildcats is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. UMass Lowell River Hawks has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UMass Lowell River Hawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.38 (ranked #307 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>New Hampshire Wildcats</strong> counter with 96.11 offensive efficiency (#342). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>

Getting to the line matters too. UMass Lowell River Hawks's free throw rate sits at 37.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. New Hampshire Wildcats check in at 26.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, UMass Lowell River Hawks convert 64.6% while New Hampshire Wildcats hit 68.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
