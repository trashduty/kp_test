<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Bethune-Cookman Wildcats's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap.

</p>

<strong>Bethune-Cookman Wildcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.02 (ranked #286 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Alabama A&M Bulldogs</strong> counter with 103.35 offensive efficiency (#266). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
