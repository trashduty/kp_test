These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Oklahoma Sooners's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 164.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Georgia Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 118.39 (ranked #37 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. At 31.8% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Oklahoma Sooners</strong> counter with 118.70 offensive efficiency (#32). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
