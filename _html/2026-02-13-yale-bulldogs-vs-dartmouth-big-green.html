These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Yale Bulldogs has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Dartmouth Big Green needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

<strong>Yale Bulldogs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 123.08 (ranked #4 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 41.7% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
