<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen (17-6) hosts Lafayette Leopards (7-16) at Alumni Hall in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 135.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Navy Midshipmen is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Lafayette Leopards has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 135.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Lafayette Leopards</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.88 (ranked #272 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Navy Midshipmen</strong> counter with 109.70 offensive efficiency (#149). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Lafayette Leopards operate at a 67.3 tempo (#247), while Navy Midshipmen play at 65.7 (#317). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.5) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Lafayette Leopards shoot 47.5% on two-pointers, while Navy Midshipmen convert at 52.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Lafayette Leopards's free throw rate sits at 32.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Navy Midshipmen check in at 38.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Lafayette Leopards convert 68.6% while Navy Midshipmen hit 74.1%. Navy Midshipmen's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Navy Midshipmen get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Lafayette Leopards is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Mike McGarvey leads Lafayette Leopards while Jon Perry guides Navy Midshipmen. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
