<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Eastern Washington Eagles (9-17) travels to face Sacramento St Hornets (9-16) at Hornet Pavilion in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Eastern Washington Eagles favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 162.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Eastern Washington Eagles's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 162.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Eastern Washington Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.71 (ranked #144 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 36.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Sacramento St Hornets</strong> counter with 104.76 offensive efficiency (#253). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<p>
Eastern Washington Eagles operate at a 69.1 tempo (#148), while Sacramento St Hornets play at 72.7 (#20). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.9) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Eastern Washington Eagles's free throw rate sits at 34.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Sacramento St Hornets check in at 41.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Eastern Washington Eagles convert 75.8% while Sacramento St Hornets hit 78.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
