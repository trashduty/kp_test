These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Stony Brook Seawolves is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Northeastern Huskies has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Northeastern Huskies</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.68 (ranked #170 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
