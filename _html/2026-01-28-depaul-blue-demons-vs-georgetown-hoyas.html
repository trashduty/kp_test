<p>
When DePaul Blue Demons (12-8) travels to face Georgetown Hoyas (10-10) at Capital One Arena, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Georgetown Hoyas is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. DePaul Blue Demons has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>DePaul Blue Demons</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.21 (ranked #211 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Georgetown Hoyas</strong> counter with 109.84 offensive efficiency (#143). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.7%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. DePaul Blue Demons's free throw rate sits at 41.4, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Georgetown Hoyas check in at 39.7, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, DePaul Blue Demons convert 70.1% while Georgetown Hoyas hit 73.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Georgetown Hoyas get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor.
