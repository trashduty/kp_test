<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans (9-12) travels to face Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles (7-14) at Eblen Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.12 (ranked #297 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles</strong> counter with 98.49 offensive efficiency (#325). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.8%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans's free throw rate sits at 29.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles check in at 33.6, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans convert 68.2% while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles hit 73.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
