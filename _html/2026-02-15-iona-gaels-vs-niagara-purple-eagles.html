<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Iona Gaels (15-11) travels to face Niagara Purple Eagles (6-19) at Gallagher Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Iona Gaels favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Iona Gaels is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Niagara Purple Eagles has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Iona Gaels</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.58 (ranked #231 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Niagara Purple Eagles</strong> counter with 98.82 offensive efficiency (#330). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Iona Gaels operate at a 69.0 tempo (#162), while Niagara Purple Eagles play at 63.2 (#365). Iona Gaels want to run, but Niagara Purple Eagles prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 66.1) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Iona Gaels shoot 50.5% on two-pointers, while Niagara Purple Eagles convert at 49.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Iona Gaels's free throw rate sits at 28.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Niagara Purple Eagles check in at 25.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Iona Gaels convert 70.7% while Niagara Purple Eagles hit 70.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
