These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Providence Friars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. DePaul Blue Demons has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>DePaul Blue Demons</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.07 (ranked #237 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Providence Friars</strong> counter with 117.26 offensive efficiency (#50). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

</p>
