These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Northern Arizona Lumberjacks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.66 (ranked #257 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>N Colorado Bears</strong> counter with 113.33 offensive efficiency (#85). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
