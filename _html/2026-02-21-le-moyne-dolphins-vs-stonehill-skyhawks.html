<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Le Moyne Dolphins (14-14) travels to face Stonehill Skyhawks (9-19) at Merkert Gymnasium in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Le Moyne Dolphins favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Le Moyne Dolphins's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Le Moyne Dolphins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.52 (ranked #232 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Stonehill Skyhawks</strong> counter with 92.36 offensive efficiency (#361). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

Getting to the line matters too. Le Moyne Dolphins's free throw rate sits at 40.2, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Stonehill Skyhawks check in at 25.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Le Moyne Dolphins convert 71.3% while Stonehill Skyhawks hit 68.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
