<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>

The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Sacramento St Hornets</strong> counter with 102.46 offensive efficiency (#278). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
