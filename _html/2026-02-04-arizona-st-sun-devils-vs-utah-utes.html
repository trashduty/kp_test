<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Arizona St Sun Devils (11-11) travels to face Utah Utes (9-12) at Huntsman Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Utah Utes favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 163.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Utah Utes's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 163.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Arizona St Sun Devils</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.56 (ranked #127 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Utah Utes</strong> counter with 112.25 offensive efficiency (#103). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.6%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Arizona St Sun Devils operate at a 71.6 tempo (#48), while Utah Utes play at 70.5 (#96). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>

Getting to the line matters too. Arizona St Sun Devils's free throw rate sits at 40.3, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Utah Utes check in at 33.8, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Arizona St Sun Devils convert 73.6% while Utah Utes hit 73.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
