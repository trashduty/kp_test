<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
LIU Sharks (18-9) enters hostile territory as they take on St. Francis (PA) Red Flash (6-20) at DeGol Arena in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into LIU Sharks favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us LIU Sharks has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. St. Francis (PA) Red Flash needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>LIU Sharks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.36 (ranked #215 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.4% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>St. Francis (PA) Red Flash</strong> counter with 98.80 offensive efficiency (#332). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. LIU Sharks's free throw rate sits at 32.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. St. Francis (PA) Red Flash check in at 30.4, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, LIU Sharks convert 65.7% while St. Francis (PA) Red Flash hit 69.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
