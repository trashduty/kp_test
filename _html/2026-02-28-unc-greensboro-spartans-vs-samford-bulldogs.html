These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Samford Bulldogs has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UNC Greensboro Spartans needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UNC Greensboro Spartans</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.18 (ranked #135 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Samford Bulldogs</strong> counter with 112.02 offensive efficiency (#100). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

UNC Greensboro Spartans operate at a 68.7 tempo (#170), while Samford Bulldogs play at 68.3 (#196). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.5) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
