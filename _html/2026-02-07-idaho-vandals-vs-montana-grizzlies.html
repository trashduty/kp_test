<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Montana Grizzlies (13-11) hosts Idaho Vandals (13-10) at Dahlberg Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Montana Grizzlies favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Montana Grizzlies's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Idaho Vandals</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.27 (ranked #158 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Montana Grizzlies</strong> counter with 108.59 offensive efficiency (#173). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.0%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Idaho Vandals operate at a 69.5 tempo (#144), while Montana Grizzlies play at 71.1 (#73). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Idaho Vandals shoot 52.1% on two-pointers, while Montana Grizzlies convert at 57.1%. Montana Grizzlies has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Idaho Vandals's free throw rate sits at 36.6, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Montana Grizzlies check in at 36.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Idaho Vandals convert 74.5% while Montana Grizzlies hit 78.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Montana Grizzlies get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Idaho Vandals is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Alex Pribble leads Idaho Vandals while Travis DeCuire guides Montana Grizzlies. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
