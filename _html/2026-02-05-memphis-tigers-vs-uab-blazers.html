<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Memphis Tigers (10-11) travels to face UAB Blazers (14-8) at Bartow Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into UAB Blazers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 151.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. UAB Blazers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 151.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Memphis Tigers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 103.99 (ranked #253 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>UAB Blazers</strong> counter with 110.94 offensive efficiency (#118). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.6%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Memphis Tigers operate at a 71.0 tempo (#75), while UAB Blazers play at 71.2 (#64). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Memphis Tigers shoot 49.5% on two-pointers, while UAB Blazers convert at 51.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Memphis Tigers's free throw rate sits at 34.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. UAB Blazers check in at 37.6, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Memphis Tigers convert 71.2% while UAB Blazers hit 71.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, UAB Blazers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Memphis Tigers. 
From a coaching perspective, Penny Hardaway leads Memphis Tigers while Andy Kennedy guides UAB Blazers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
