The early betting action has shaped into Wright St Raiders favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 144.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Wright St Raiders is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Green Bay Phoenix has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Wright St Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 114.39 (ranked #78 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Green Bay Phoenix</strong> counter with 112.19 offensive efficiency (#104). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Wright St Raiders operate at a 68.9 tempo (#188), while Green Bay Phoenix play at 65.1 (#335). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.0) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Wright St Raiders's free throw rate sits at 36.3, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Green Bay Phoenix check in at 42.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Wright St Raiders convert 73.5% while Green Bay Phoenix hit 74.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
