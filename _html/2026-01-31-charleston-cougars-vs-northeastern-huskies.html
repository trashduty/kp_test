<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Charleston Cougars (14-8) travels to face Northeastern Huskies (6-14) at Cabot Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Charleston Cougars favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 162.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Charleston Cougars is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Northeastern Huskies has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 162.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Charleston Cougars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.37 (ranked #154 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Northeastern Huskies</strong> counter with 108.71 offensive efficiency (#169). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Charleston Cougars operate at a 69.2 tempo (#168), while Northeastern Huskies play at 70.2 (#120). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.7) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Charleston Cougars shoot 53.8% on two-pointers, while Northeastern Huskies convert at 54.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Charleston Cougars's free throw rate sits at 44.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Northeastern Huskies check in at 32.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Charleston Cougars convert 73.7% while Northeastern Huskies hit 69.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Northeastern Huskies get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Charleston Cougars. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Mack leads Charleston Cougars while Bill Coen guides Northeastern Huskies. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
