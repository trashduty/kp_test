These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Idaho State Bengals's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 153.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Weber State Wildcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 112.25 (ranked #97 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
