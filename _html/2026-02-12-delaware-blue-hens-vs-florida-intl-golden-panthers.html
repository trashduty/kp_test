<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Florida Int'l Golden Panthers (11-12) hosts Delaware Blue Hens (7-16) at Ocean Bank Convocation Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Florida Int'l Golden Panthers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Delaware Blue Hens needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Delaware Blue Hens</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.83 (ranked #280 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.7% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Florida Int'l Golden Panthers</strong> counter with 107.07 offensive efficiency (#197). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Delaware Blue Hens's free throw rate sits at 28.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Florida Int'l Golden Panthers check in at 40.9, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Delaware Blue Hens convert 75.8% while Florida Int'l Golden Panthers hit 68.6%. Delaware Blue Hens's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
