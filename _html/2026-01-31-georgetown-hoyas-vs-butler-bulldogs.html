These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Butler Bulldogs is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Georgetown Hoyas has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Georgetown Hoyas</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.26 (ranked #134 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 32.0% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Butler Bulldogs</strong> counter with 114.62 offensive efficiency (#74). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>
