<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Lehigh Mountain Hawks (14-16) hosts Bucknell Bison (9-21) at Stabler Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Lehigh Mountain Hawks favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Lehigh Mountain Hawks is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Bucknell Bison has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Bucknell Bison</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 98.66 (ranked #338 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Lehigh Mountain Hawks</strong> counter with 103.50 offensive efficiency (#279). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Bucknell Bison operate at a 67.1 tempo (#247), while Lehigh Mountain Hawks play at 66.6 (#274). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.9) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Bucknell Bison shoot 49.8% on two-pointers, while Lehigh Mountain Hawks convert at 52.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Bucknell Bison's free throw rate sits at 31.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Lehigh Mountain Hawks check in at 31.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Bucknell Bison convert 77.1% while Lehigh Mountain Hawks hit 72.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Lehigh Mountain Hawks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Bucknell Bison is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, John Griffin leads Bucknell Bison while Brett Reed guides Lehigh Mountain Hawks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>

<h2>Bucknell Bison</h2>
