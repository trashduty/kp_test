<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Howard Bison (13-9) enters hostile territory as they take on Coppin St Eagles (3-20) at Physical Education Complex Arena in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Howard Bison favored by 13.5 points, with the total sitting at 146.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 13.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Coppin St Eagles to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Howard Bison to play below their standard. The total of 146.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Howard Bison</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.21 (ranked #298 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Coppin St Eagles</strong> counter with 92.03 offensive efficiency (#361). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Howard Bison operate at a 69.4 tempo (#150), while Coppin St Eagles play at 70.1 (#116). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.8) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Howard Bison shoot 46.6% on two-pointers, while Coppin St Eagles convert at 44.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Howard Bison's free throw rate sits at 41.5, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Coppin St Eagles check in at 37.7, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Howard Bison convert 73.4% while Coppin St Eagles hit 68.3%. Howard Bison's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Coppin St Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Howard Bison. 
From a coaching perspective, Kenny Blakeney leads Howard Bison while Larry Stewart guides Coppin St Eagles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Howard Bison significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Coppin St Eagles will need their best performance to stay competitive.
