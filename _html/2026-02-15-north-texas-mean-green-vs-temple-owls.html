<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When North Texas Mean Green (14-11) travels to face Temple Owls (15-9) at The Liacouras Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Temple Owls favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 136.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Temple Owls's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 136.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>North Texas Mean Green</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.61 (ranked #301 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Temple Owls</strong> counter with 112.48 offensive efficiency (#93). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
North Texas Mean Green operate at a 66.4 tempo (#288), while Temple Owls play at 65.6 (#321). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.0) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, North Texas Mean Green shoot 47.9% on two-pointers, while Temple Owls convert at 49.5%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. North Texas Mean Green's free throw rate sits at 39.7, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Temple Owls check in at 43.1, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, North Texas Mean Green convert 70.7% while Temple Owls hit 75.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Temple Owls get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Daniyal Robinson leads North Texas Mean Green while Adam Fisher guides Temple Owls. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
