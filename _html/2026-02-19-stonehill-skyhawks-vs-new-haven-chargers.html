<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When Stonehill Skyhawks (9-18) travels to face New Haven Chargers (11-15) at The Hazell Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into New Haven Chargers favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 119.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. New Haven Chargers's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 119.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Stonehill Skyhawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 92.94 (ranked #360 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>New Haven Chargers</strong> counter with 94.56 offensive efficiency (#355). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Stonehill Skyhawks operate at a 66.0 tempo (#303), while New Haven Chargers play at 63.4 (#364). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 64.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Stonehill Skyhawks shoot 45.7% on two-pointers, while New Haven Chargers convert at 50.3%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Stonehill Skyhawks's free throw rate sits at 26.1, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. New Haven Chargers check in at 30.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Stonehill Skyhawks convert 69.2% while New Haven Chargers hit 69.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, New Haven Chargers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Kraus leads Stonehill Skyhawks while Ted Hotaling guides New Haven Chargers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
