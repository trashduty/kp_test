<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
South Dakota St Jackrabbits (10-11) travels to face Omaha Mavericks (10-12) at Baxter Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into South Dakota St Jackrabbits favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. South Dakota St Jackrabbits's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>South Dakota St Jackrabbits</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.59 (ranked #171 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Omaha Mavericks</strong> counter with 105.49 offensive efficiency (#223). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. South Dakota St Jackrabbits's free throw rate sits at 32.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Omaha Mavericks check in at 35.8, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, South Dakota St Jackrabbits convert 69.7% while Omaha Mavericks hit 70.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
