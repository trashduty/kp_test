<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders (14-12) travels to face Maine Black Bears (6-20) at Memorial Gym in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into NJIT Highlanders favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 133.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. NJIT Highlanders's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 133.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>NJIT Highlanders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 99.45 (ranked #321 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Maine Black Bears</strong> counter with 94.45 offensive efficiency (#355). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.1%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
NJIT Highlanders operate at a 68.8 tempo (#178), while Maine Black Bears play at 64.8 (#338). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, NJIT Highlanders shoot 47.4% on two-pointers, while Maine Black Bears convert at 50.8%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. NJIT Highlanders's free throw rate sits at 34.1, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Maine Black Bears check in at 37.7, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, NJIT Highlanders convert 71.3% while Maine Black Bears hit 64.7%. NJIT Highlanders's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Maine Black Bears get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for NJIT Highlanders. 
From a coaching perspective, Grant Billmeier leads NJIT Highlanders while Chris Markwood guides Maine Black Bears. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, NJIT Highlanders holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but Maine Black Bears could make this interesting if they play to their potential. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
