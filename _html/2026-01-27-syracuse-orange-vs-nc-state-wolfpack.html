These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us NC State Wolfpack has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Syracuse Orange needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Syracuse Orange</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.48 (ranked #152 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>NC State Wolfpack</strong> counter with 119.98 offensive efficiency (#27). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 39.4%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

NC State Wolfpack's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>
