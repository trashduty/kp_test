<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Louisville Cardinals (16-6) enters hostile territory as they take on Wake Forest Demon Deacons (11-11) at Joel Coliseum in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Louisville Cardinals favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at 159.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Louisville Cardinals has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Wake Forest Demon Deacons needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 159.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Louisville Cardinals</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 119.45 (ranked #28 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 34.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Wake Forest Demon Deacons</strong> counter with 110.95 offensive efficiency (#117). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Louisville Cardinals operate at a 71.6 tempo (#50), while Wake Forest Demon Deacons play at 71.4 (#57). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.5) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<p>
Inside the paint, Louisville Cardinals shoot 60.1% on two-pointers, while Wake Forest Demon Deacons convert at 54.0%. Louisville Cardinals has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Louisville Cardinals's free throw rate sits at 34.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Wake Forest Demon Deacons check in at 33.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Louisville Cardinals convert 76.4% while Wake Forest Demon Deacons hit 76.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
