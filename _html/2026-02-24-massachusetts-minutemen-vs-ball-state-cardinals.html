These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>

The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.8% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Ball State Cardinals</strong> counter with 97.88 offensive efficiency (#342). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 30.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
