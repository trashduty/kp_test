<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
When Florida A&M Rattlers (9-13) travels to face Jackson St Tigers (7-17) at Williams Center, we're looking at a matchup between two programs with similar profiles in the national landscape. The early betting action has shaped into Florida A&M Rattlers favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Florida A&M Rattlers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Florida A&M Rattlers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 97.15 (ranked #342 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Jackson St Tigers</strong> counter with 95.68 offensive efficiency (#348). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Florida A&M Rattlers operate at a 70.7 tempo (#80), while Jackson St Tigers play at 71.5 (#47). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Florida A&M Rattlers shoot 48.8% on two-pointers, while Jackson St Tigers convert at 44.7%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Florida A&M Rattlers's free throw rate sits at 37.3, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Jackson St Tigers check in at 33.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Florida A&M Rattlers convert 66.7% while Jackson St Tigers hit 76.7%. Jackson St Tigers's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Jackson St Tigers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. In a fairly even matchup, home court becomes magnified as a potential deciding factor. 
From a coaching perspective, Charlie Ward leads Florida A&M Rattlers while Mo Williams guides Jackson St Tigers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>
