These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Tulsa Golden Hurricane has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UAB Blazers needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 160.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UAB Blazers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.30 (ranked #130 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. At 28.2% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tulsa Golden Hurricane</strong> counter with 123.12 offensive efficiency (#5). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 40.3%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

Tulsa Golden Hurricane's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>
