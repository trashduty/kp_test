<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
American Eagles (16-14) hosts Boston Univ. Terriers (14-16) at Bender Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into American Eagles favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. American Eagles's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Boston Univ. Terriers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 114.83 (ranked #66 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.0% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>American Eagles</strong> counter with 107.99 offensive efficiency (#188). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Boston Univ. Terriers operate at a 63.7 tempo (#358), while American Eagles play at 67.0 (#253). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Boston Univ. Terriers shoot 56.3% on two-pointers, while American Eagles convert at 53.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Boston Univ. Terriers's free throw rate sits at 32.1, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. American Eagles check in at 29.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Boston Univ. Terriers convert 72.6% while American Eagles hit 75.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, American Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Boston Univ. Terriers is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Joe Jones leads Boston Univ. Terriers while Duane Simpkins guides American Eagles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

<h2>Boston Univ. Terriers</h2>
