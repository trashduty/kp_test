<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Boston Univ. Terriers (13-16) hosts Holy Cross Crusaders (10-19) at Case Gym in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Boston Univ. Terriers favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 143.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Boston Univ. Terriers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Holy Cross Crusaders needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 143.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Holy Cross Crusaders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.97 (ranked #283 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Boston Univ. Terriers</strong> counter with 114.56 offensive efficiency (#72). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 39.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Holy Cross Crusaders operate at a 65.9 tempo (#308), while Boston Univ. Terriers play at 63.7 (#360). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 64.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Holy Cross Crusaders shoot 50.7% on two-pointers, while Boston Univ. Terriers convert at 55.8%. Boston Univ. Terriers has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Holy Cross Crusaders's free throw rate sits at 31.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Boston Univ. Terriers check in at 32.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Holy Cross Crusaders convert 75.7% while Boston Univ. Terriers hit 72.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Boston Univ. Terriers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Holy Cross Crusaders is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Dave Paulsen leads Holy Cross Crusaders while Joe Jones guides Boston Univ. Terriers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
