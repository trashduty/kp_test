<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
SMU Mustangs (16-7) hosts Notre Dame Fighting Irish (11-13) at Moody Coliseum in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into SMU Mustangs favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 152.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us SMU Mustangs has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Notre Dame Fighting Irish needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Notre Dame Fighting Irish</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.05 (ranked #161 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>SMU Mustangs</strong> counter with 118.92 offensive efficiency (#32). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.4%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Notre Dame Fighting Irish operate at a 66.4 tempo (#288), while SMU Mustangs play at 71.8 (#41). SMU Mustangs like to push the pace, while Notre Dame Fighting Irish want to control the clock. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The moderate pace (around 69.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Notre Dame Fighting Irish shoot 51.3% on two-pointers, while SMU Mustangs convert at 56.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Notre Dame Fighting Irish's free throw rate sits at 33.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. SMU Mustangs check in at 33.1, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Notre Dame Fighting Irish convert 68.7% while SMU Mustangs hit 76.2%. SMU Mustangs's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, SMU Mustangs get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Notre Dame Fighting Irish is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Micah Shrewsberry leads Notre Dame Fighting Irish while Andy Enfield guides SMU Mustangs. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
