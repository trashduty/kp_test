<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 15.5-point spread screams mismatch.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Miss Valley St Delta Devils</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 89.25 (ranked #364 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.8% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Alabama A&M Bulldogs</strong> counter with 102.31 offensive efficiency (#290). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
