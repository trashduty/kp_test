<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Florida Gulf Coast Eagles (14-16) travels to face Stetson Hatters (10-20) at Edmunds Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Florida Gulf Coast Eagles favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 152.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Florida Gulf Coast Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.41 (ranked #128 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Stetson Hatters</strong> counter with 104.52 offensive efficiency (#259). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.3% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Florida Gulf Coast Eagles operate at a 69.5 tempo (#124), while Stetson Hatters play at 68.2 (#202). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.9) should create a standard flow.

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>

Getting to the line matters too. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles's free throw rate sits at 30.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Stetson Hatters check in at 33.4, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles convert 71.9% while Stetson Hatters hit 68.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
