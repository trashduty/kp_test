These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. South Carolina St Bulldogs's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 156.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Morgan St Bears</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.14 (ranked #320 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 30.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>South Carolina St Bulldogs</strong> counter with 94.79 offensive efficiency (#355). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Morgan St Bears's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>
