<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
James Madison Dukes (11-12) hosts Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns (7-16) at Atlantic Union Bank Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into James Madison Dukes favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 131.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us James Madison Dukes has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 131.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 97.04 (ranked #338 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>James Madison Dukes</strong> counter with 110.12 offensive efficiency (#140). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.2%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns operate at a 63.3 tempo (#365), while James Madison Dukes play at 67.5 (#241). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.4) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

James Madison Dukes check in at 35.8, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns convert 68.7% while James Madison Dukes hit 70.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>

From a coaching perspective, Quannas White leads Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns while Preston Spradlin guides James Madison Dukes. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
