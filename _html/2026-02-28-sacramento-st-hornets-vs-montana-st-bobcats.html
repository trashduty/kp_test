These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Montana St Bobcats</strong> counter with 110.47 offensive efficiency (#125). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
