<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Wright St Raiders (15-8) travels to face Robert Morris Colonials (14-10) at UPMC Events Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Wright St Raiders favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Wright St Raiders's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Wright St Raiders</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 115.19 (ranked #70 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Robert Morris Colonials</strong> counter with 112.21 offensive efficiency (#104). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.5%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Wright St Raiders's free throw rate sits at 37.1, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Robert Morris Colonials check in at 29.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wright St Raiders convert 74.5% while Robert Morris Colonials hit 69.4%. Wright St Raiders's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
