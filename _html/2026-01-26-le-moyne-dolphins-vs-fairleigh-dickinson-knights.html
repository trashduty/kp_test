<h1>Le Moyne Dolphins vs Fairleigh Dickinson Knights</h1>
<h2>Game Preview for January 26, 2026</h2>

<div class="betting-lines">
  <h3>Betting Lines</h3>
  <p><strong>Spread:</strong> Le Moyne Dolphins -2.5</p>
  <p><strong>Moneyline:</strong> Le Moyne Dolphins (-152) | Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (+129)</p>
  <p><strong>Total:</strong> 140.5</p>
</div>

<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<p>
#### Setting the Stage
Le Moyne Dolphins (10-10) enters hostile territory as they take on Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (7-13) at Bogota Savings Bank Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Le Moyne Dolphins favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<p>
#### Breaking Down the Spread
A spread under a field goal suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Le Moyne Dolphins's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent disparity. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<p>
#### Offensive Firepower
</p>
<strong>Le Moyne Dolphins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 106.60 (ranked #205 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Fairleigh Dickinson Knights</strong> counter with 99.30 offensive efficiency (#317). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<p>
#### Tempo & Playing Style
Le Moyne Dolphins operate at a 68.7 tempo (#203), while Fairleigh Dickinson Knights play at 66.2 (#305). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.4) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<p>
#### The Interior Battle
Inside the paint, Le Moyne Dolphins shoot 52.3% on two-pointers, while Fairleigh Dickinson Knights convert at 47.5%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Le Moyne Dolphins's free throw rate sits at 39.4, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights check in at 33.8, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Le Moyne Dolphins convert 72.2% while Fairleigh Dickinson Knights hit 68.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<p>
#### X-Factors & Intangibles
Playing at home, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Le Moyne Dolphins. 
From a coaching perspective, Nate Champion leads Le Moyne Dolphins while Jack Castleberry guides Fairleigh Dickinson Knights. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
Defensively, Le Moyne Dolphins (#204 defensive efficiency) should have success against Fairleigh Dickinson Knights's weaker defense (#297). 
</p>

<p>
#### The Betting Angle
Small spreads like 2.5 create interesting dynamics. I'm looking at whether Le Moyne Dolphins can actually separate, or if this stays inside one possession. 
Regarding the total of 140.5: The total seems fairly priced. I'd need to see where sharp money moves it. 
</p>

<p>
The sharp play isn't always obvious. Watch for line movement, injury reports, and whether the public is hammering one side. That's where the value emerges.
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Le Moyne Dolphins significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights will need their best performance of the season to pull off the upset.
