These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Cleveland St Vikings to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Robert Morris Colonials to play below their standard.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Cleveland St Vikings</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.83 (ranked #118 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 37.5% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Robert Morris Colonials</strong> counter with 114.13 offensive efficiency (#77). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 38.1%, giving them spacing and shot creation.
