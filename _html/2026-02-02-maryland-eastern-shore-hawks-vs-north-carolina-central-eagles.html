These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 93.35 (ranked #355 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 27.7% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>North Carolina Central Eagles</strong> counter with 97.53 offensive efficiency (#332). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.5%, forcing them to grind in the half court.

When they do get fouled, Maryland-Eastern Shore Hawks convert 70.7% while North Carolina Central Eagles hit 74.9%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
