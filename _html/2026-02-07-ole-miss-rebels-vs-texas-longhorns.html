<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Texas Longhorns (14-9) hosts Ole Miss Rebels (11-11) at Moody Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Texas Longhorns favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at 147.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Texas Longhorns has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Ole Miss Rebels needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 147.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Ole Miss Rebels</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.57 (ranked #153 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Texas Longhorns</strong> counter with 120.80 offensive efficiency (#21). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 34.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Ole Miss Rebels operate at a 67.3 tempo (#245), while Texas Longhorns play at 68.9 (#178). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Ole Miss Rebels shoot 49.8% on two-pointers, while Texas Longhorns convert at 57.2%. Texas Longhorns has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Ole Miss Rebels's free throw rate sits at 34.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Texas Longhorns check in at 47.4, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Ole Miss Rebels convert 73.8% while Texas Longhorns hit 74.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Texas Longhorns get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Ole Miss Rebels is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Beard leads Ole Miss Rebels while Sean Miller guides Texas Longhorns. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
