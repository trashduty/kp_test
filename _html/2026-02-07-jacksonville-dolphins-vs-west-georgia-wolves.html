<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Jacksonville Dolphins (9-15) travels to face West Georgia Wolves (10-13) at The Coliseum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into West Georgia Wolves favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 137.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. West Georgia Wolves's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 137.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Jacksonville Dolphins</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.26 (ranked #288 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>West Georgia Wolves</strong> counter with 103.72 offensive efficiency (#261). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Jacksonville Dolphins operate at a 65.5 tempo (#324), while West Georgia Wolves play at 70.2 (#110). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Jacksonville Dolphins shoot 51.5% on two-pointers, while West Georgia Wolves convert at 47.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Jacksonville Dolphins's free throw rate sits at 31.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. West Georgia Wolves check in at 29.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Jacksonville Dolphins convert 71.2% while West Georgia Wolves hit 71.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, West Georgia Wolves get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Jacksonville Dolphins. 
From a coaching perspective, Jordan Mincy leads Jacksonville Dolphins while Dave Moore guides West Georgia Wolves. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
On paper, Jacksonville Dolphins holds the advantage as the higher-ranked team, but West Georgia Wolves could make this interesting if they play to their potential. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Jacksonville Dolphins</h2>
