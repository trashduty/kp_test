These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Incarnate Word Cardinals's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 156.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up.

<strong>New Orleans Privateers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.94 (ranked #223 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone.
