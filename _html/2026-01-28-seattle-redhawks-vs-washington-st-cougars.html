<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Seattle Redhawks (14-8) travels to face Washington St Cougars (9-13) at Beasley Coliseum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Washington St Cougars favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 142.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Washington St Cougars's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Seattle Redhawks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.94 (ranked #285 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Washington St Cougars</strong> counter with 110.12 offensive efficiency (#134). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Seattle Redhawks operate at a 69.4 tempo (#157), while Washington St Cougars play at 68.9 (#194). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Seattle Redhawks shoot 50.1% on two-pointers, while Washington St Cougars convert at 55.8%. Washington St Cougars has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Seattle Redhawks's free throw rate sits at 33.0, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Washington St Cougars check in at 32.4, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Seattle Redhawks convert 69.6% while Washington St Cougars hit 73.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Washington St Cougars get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Seattle Redhawks. 
From a coaching perspective, Chris Victor leads Seattle Redhawks while David Riley guides Washington St Cougars. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
