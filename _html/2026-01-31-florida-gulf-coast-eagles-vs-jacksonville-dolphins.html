<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Florida Gulf Coast Eagles (9-13) travels to face Jacksonville Dolphins (9-13) at Swisher Gymnasium in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Jacksonville Dolphins favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 140.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Jacksonville Dolphins's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Florida Gulf Coast Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.59 (ranked #126 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 36.0% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Jacksonville Dolphins</strong> counter with 102.82 offensive efficiency (#267). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Florida Gulf Coast Eagles operate at a 70.2 tempo (#117), while Jacksonville Dolphins play at 65.2 (#334). Florida Gulf Coast Eagles want to run, but Jacksonville Dolphins prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The slower pace (averaging 67.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles shoot 52.0% on two-pointers, while Jacksonville Dolphins convert at 51.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles's free throw rate sits at 30.1, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Jacksonville Dolphins check in at 30.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles convert 74.6% while Jacksonville Dolphins hit 70.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Jacksonville Dolphins get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Florida Gulf Coast Eagles. 
From a coaching perspective, Pat Chambers leads Florida Gulf Coast Eagles while Jordan Mincy guides Jacksonville Dolphins. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
