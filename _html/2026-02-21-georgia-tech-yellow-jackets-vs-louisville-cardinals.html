<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Louisville Cardinals (19-7) hosts Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (11-16) at KFC Yum! Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Louisville Cardinals favored by 22.5 points, with the total sitting at 163.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 22.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Louisville Cardinals to play below their standard. The total of 163.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.97 (ranked #282 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Louisville Cardinals</strong> counter with 120.42 offensive efficiency (#18). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets operate at a 71.9 tempo (#36), while Louisville Cardinals play at 71.9 (#33). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.9) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets shoot 48.3% on two-pointers, while Louisville Cardinals convert at 60.0%. Louisville Cardinals has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets's free throw rate sits at 33.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Louisville Cardinals check in at 35.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets convert 69.6% while Louisville Cardinals hit 77.3%. Louisville Cardinals's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Louisville Cardinals get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Damon Stoudamire leads Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets while Pat Kelsey guides Louisville Cardinals. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Louisville Cardinals significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets will need their best performance to stay competitive.
