<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Nevada Wolf Pack (17-8) enters hostile territory as they take on San José St Spartans (6-19) at Provident Credit Union Event Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Nevada Wolf Pack favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 142.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us Nevada Wolf Pack has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. San José St Spartans needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Nevada Wolf Pack</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 114.14 (ranked #72 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.0% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>San José St Spartans</strong> counter with 104.11 offensive efficiency (#264). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Nevada Wolf Pack operate at a 66.0 tempo (#303), while San José St Spartans play at 65.4 (#326). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Nevada Wolf Pack shoot 46.4% on two-pointers, while San José St Spartans convert at 45.4%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Nevada Wolf Pack's free throw rate sits at 44.4, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. San José St Spartans check in at 33.2, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Nevada Wolf Pack convert 75.7% while San José St Spartans hit 75.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, San José St Spartans get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Nevada Wolf Pack. 
From a coaching perspective, Steve Alford leads Nevada Wolf Pack while Tim Miles guides San José St Spartans. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
