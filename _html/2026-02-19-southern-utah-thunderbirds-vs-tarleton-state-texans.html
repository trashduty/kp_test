These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Tarleton State Texans is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Southern Utah Thunderbirds</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 99.23 (ranked #327 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tarleton State Texans</strong> counter with 100.49 offensive efficiency (#313). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.6%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
