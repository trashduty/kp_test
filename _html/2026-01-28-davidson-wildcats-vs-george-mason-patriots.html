<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
George Mason Patriots (18-2) hosts Davidson Wildcats (12-7) at EagleBank Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into George Mason Patriots favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 135.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us George Mason Patriots has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Davidson Wildcats needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 135.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Davidson Wildcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.42 (ranked #175 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.4% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>George Mason Patriots</strong> counter with 116.66 offensive efficiency (#59). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Davidson Wildcats operate at a 64.8 tempo (#340), while George Mason Patriots play at 66.1 (#311). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.4) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Davidson Wildcats shoot 52.1% on two-pointers, while George Mason Patriots convert at 55.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Davidson Wildcats's free throw rate sits at 34.3, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. George Mason Patriots check in at 49.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Davidson Wildcats convert 65.4% while George Mason Patriots hit 73.0%. George Mason Patriots's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, George Mason Patriots get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Davidson Wildcats is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Matt McKillop leads Davidson Wildcats while Tony Skinn guides George Mason Patriots. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
