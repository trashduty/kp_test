These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Kentucky Wildcats's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 155.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Vanderbilt Commodores</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 121.64 (ranked #11 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Kentucky Wildcats</strong> counter with 116.45 offensive efficiency (#53). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>

Vanderbilt Commodores's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
