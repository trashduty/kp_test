<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Liberty Flames (23-5) travels to face Jacksonville St Gamecocks (14-14) at Mathews Coliseum in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Liberty Flames favored by 3.5 points, with the total sitting at 141.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Liberty Flames is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Jacksonville St Gamecocks has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 141.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Liberty Flames</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 116.38 (ranked #54 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 39.4% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Jacksonville St Gamecocks</strong> counter with 105.96 offensive efficiency (#226). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Liberty Flames operate at a 65.0 tempo (#333), while Jacksonville St Gamecocks play at 65.8 (#307). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 65.4) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Liberty Flames shoot 60.8% on two-pointers, while Jacksonville St Gamecocks convert at 47.6%. Liberty Flames has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Liberty Flames's free throw rate sits at 32.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Jacksonville St Gamecocks check in at 43.2, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Liberty Flames convert 70.3% while Jacksonville St Gamecocks hit 69.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Jacksonville St Gamecocks get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Liberty Flames. 
From a coaching perspective, Ritchie McKay leads Liberty Flames while Ray Harper guides Jacksonville St Gamecocks. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
