These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 6.5-point spread indicates Eastern Kentucky Colonels is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. West Georgia Wolves has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 156.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>West Georgia Wolves</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 105.16 (ranked #237 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Eastern Kentucky Colonels</strong> counter with 109.81 offensive efficiency (#146). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 33.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
