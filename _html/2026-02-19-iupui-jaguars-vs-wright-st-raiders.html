<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Wright St Raiders (17-10) hosts IUPUI Jaguars (7-21) at Nutter Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Wright St Raiders favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at 162.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking IUPUI Jaguars to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Wright St Raiders to play below their standard. The total of 162.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>IUPUI Jaguars</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.32 (ranked #192 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Wright St Raiders</strong> counter with 115.27 offensive efficiency (#62). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.8% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
IUPUI Jaguars operate at a 75.1 tempo (#6), while Wright St Raiders play at 68.5 (#185). IUPUI Jaguars want to run, but Wright St Raiders prefer to slow things down. This tempo battle will be crucial—whoever dictates pace gains a significant edge. The moderate pace (around 71.8) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, IUPUI Jaguars shoot 54.5% on two-pointers, while Wright St Raiders convert at 54.6%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. IUPUI Jaguars's free throw rate sits at 21.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Wright St Raiders check in at 37.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, IUPUI Jaguars convert 72.5% while Wright St Raiders hit 73.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Wright St Raiders get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—IUPUI Jaguars is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Ben Howlett leads IUPUI Jaguars while Clint Sargent guides Wright St Raiders. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
