These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Queens University Royals has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. North Alabama Lions needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 155.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Queens University Royals</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 118.97 (ranked #32 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. Their 35.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>North Alabama Lions</strong> counter with 102.90 offensive efficiency (#284). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<p>
Queens University Royals operate at a 70.6 tempo (#80), while North Alabama Lions play at 65.9 (#308). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.3) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Queens University Royals's free throw rate sits at 34.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. North Alabama Lions check in at 38.5, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Queens University Royals convert 74.3% while North Alabama Lions hit 68.4%. Queens University Royals's superior free throw shooting could be the difference in a tight game. 
</p>

From a coaching perspective, Grant Leonard leads Queens University Royals while Tony Pujol guides North Alabama Lions. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
Queens University Royals's offense (#32) should have success against North Alabama Lions's weaker defense (#353).
