<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Hofstra Pride (16-9) travels to face Charleston Cougars (16-9) at TD Arena in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Charleston Cougars favored by 0.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Charleston Cougars's 0.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Hofstra Pride</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.31 (ranked #84 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 38.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Charleston Cougars</strong> counter with 109.58 offensive efficiency (#152). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 29.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Hofstra Pride operate at a 66.1 tempo (#301), while Charleston Cougars play at 69.2 (#155). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.7) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Hofstra Pride shoot 48.0% on two-pointers, while Charleston Cougars convert at 54.7%. Charleston Cougars has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Hofstra Pride's free throw rate sits at 30.9, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Charleston Cougars check in at 43.2, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Hofstra Pride convert 76.6% while Charleston Cougars hit 74.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Charleston Cougars get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Hofstra Pride. 
From a coaching perspective, Speedy Claxton leads Hofstra Pride while Chris Mack guides Charleston Cougars. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
