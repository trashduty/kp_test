</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Detroit Mercy Titans</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.90 (ranked #182 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Wright St Raiders</strong> counter with 114.45 offensive efficiency (#70). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.0% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
