<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 14.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Miss Valley St Delta Devils to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Alabama St Hornets to play below their standard.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Miss Valley St Delta Devils</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 89.77 (ranked #364 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.5% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Alabama St Hornets</strong> counter with 99.39 offensive efficiency (#324). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Getting to the line matters too. Miss Valley St Delta Devils's free throw rate sits at 32.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Alabama St Hornets check in at 34.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Miss Valley St Delta Devils convert 71.4% while Alabama St Hornets hit 70.8%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
