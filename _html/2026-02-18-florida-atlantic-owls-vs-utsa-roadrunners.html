<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Florida Atlantic Owls (14-12) enters hostile territory as they take on UTSA Roadrunners (5-20) at UTSA Convocation Center in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Florida Atlantic Owls favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at 157.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking UTSA Roadrunners to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Florida Atlantic Owls to play below their standard. The total of 157.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Florida Atlantic Owls</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.20 (ranked #135 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>UTSA Roadrunners</strong> counter with 96.33 offensive efficiency (#348). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 28.4%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Florida Atlantic Owls operate at a 71.3 tempo (#53), while UTSA Roadrunners play at 69.7 (#123). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.5) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Florida Atlantic Owls shoot 54.5% on two-pointers, while UTSA Roadrunners convert at 45.9%. Florida Atlantic Owls has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Florida Atlantic Owls's free throw rate sits at 32.8, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. UTSA Roadrunners check in at 30.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Florida Atlantic Owls convert 70.9% while UTSA Roadrunners hit 70.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, UTSA Roadrunners get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Florida Atlantic Owls. 
From a coaching perspective, John Jakus leads Florida Atlantic Owls while Austin Claunch guides UTSA Roadrunners. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Florida Atlantic Owls significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. UTSA Roadrunners will need their best performance to stay competitive.
