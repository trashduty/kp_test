<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Nebraska Cornhuskers (24-4) travels to face USC Trojans (18-10) at Galen Center in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Nebraska Cornhuskers favored by 4.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates Nebraska Cornhuskers is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. USC Trojans has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Nebraska Cornhuskers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 115.34 (ranked #62 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>USC Trojans</strong> counter with 108.70 offensive efficiency (#171). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.6% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<p>
Nebraska Cornhuskers operate at a 67.7 tempo (#223), while USC Trojans play at 71.2 (#53). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.5) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>

Getting to the line matters too. Nebraska Cornhuskers's free throw rate sits at 26.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. USC Trojans check in at 46.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Nebraska Cornhuskers convert 76.1% while USC Trojans hit 72.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, USC Trojans get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Nebraska Cornhuskers.
