</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 4.5-point spread indicates William & Mary Tribe is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Northeastern Huskies has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright.

</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>William & Mary Tribe</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 109.88 (ranked #145 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 33.5% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Northeastern Huskies</strong> counter with 107.52 offensive efficiency (#188). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.4% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
