<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Bethune-Cookman Wildcats (13-11) enters hostile territory as they take on Alcorn St Braves (5-18) at Whitney Complex in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Bethune-Cookman Wildcats favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 145.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Bethune-Cookman Wildcats has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Alcorn St Braves needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 145.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Bethune-Cookman Wildcats</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 102.80 (ranked #284 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Alcorn St Braves</strong> counter with 96.54 offensive efficiency (#344). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.7% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Bethune-Cookman Wildcats operate at a 70.9 tempo (#75), while Alcorn St Braves play at 69.5 (#140). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 70.2) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Bethune-Cookman Wildcats shoot 49.8% on two-pointers, while Alcorn St Braves convert at 46.1%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Bethune-Cookman Wildcats's free throw rate sits at 39.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Alcorn St Braves check in at 26.5, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Bethune-Cookman Wildcats convert 69.2% while Alcorn St Braves hit 69.0%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Alcorn St Braves get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Bethune-Cookman Wildcats. 
From a coaching perspective, Reggie Theus leads Bethune-Cookman Wildcats while Jake Morton guides Alcorn St Braves. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
