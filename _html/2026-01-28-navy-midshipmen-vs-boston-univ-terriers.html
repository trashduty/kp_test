<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen (15-6) travels to face Boston Univ. Terriers (8-13) at Case Gym in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 139.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Navy Midshipmen's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 139.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Navy Midshipmen</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 108.79 (ranked #168 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 35.2% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Boston Univ. Terriers</strong> counter with 111.61 offensive efficiency (#116). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 37.6%, giving them spacing and shot creation. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Navy Midshipmen's free throw rate sits at 41.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Boston Univ. Terriers check in at 32.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Navy Midshipmen convert 74.5% while Boston Univ. Terriers hit 71.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
