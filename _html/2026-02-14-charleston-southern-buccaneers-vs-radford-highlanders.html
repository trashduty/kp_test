These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 3.5-point spread indicates Radford Highlanders is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge.

<strong>Charleston Southern Buccaneers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 107.04 (ranked #196 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Radford Highlanders</strong> counter with 109.06 offensive efficiency (#161). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.
