<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Chattanooga Mocs (12-18) hosts VMI Keydets (6-24) at McKenzie Arena in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Chattanooga Mocs favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 152.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Chattanooga Mocs has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. VMI Keydets needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>VMI Keydets</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.41 (ranked #316 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Chattanooga Mocs</strong> counter with 107.98 offensive efficiency (#189). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 34.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
VMI Keydets operate at a 67.7 tempo (#224), while Chattanooga Mocs play at 67.9 (#215). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 67.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, VMI Keydets shoot 47.6% on two-pointers, while Chattanooga Mocs convert at 55.3%. Chattanooga Mocs has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. VMI Keydets's free throw rate sits at 30.6, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Chattanooga Mocs check in at 31.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, VMI Keydets convert 72.6% while Chattanooga Mocs hit 77.4%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Chattanooga Mocs get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—VMI Keydets is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Andrew Wilson leads VMI Keydets while Dan Earl guides Chattanooga Mocs. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with Chattanooga Mocs significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. VMI Keydets will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: Chattanooga Mocs's Offense vs VMI Keydets's Defense</strong>

</p>

<h2>VMI Keydets</h2>

<p>
