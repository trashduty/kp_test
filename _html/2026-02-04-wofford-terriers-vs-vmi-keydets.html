<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Wofford Terriers (15-8) enters hostile territory as they take on VMI Keydets (6-17) at Cameron Hall in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Wofford Terriers favored by 9.5 points, with the total sitting at 152.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Wofford Terriers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. VMI Keydets needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 152.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Wofford Terriers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 113.51 (ranked #86 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 35.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>VMI Keydets</strong> counter with 100.37 offensive efficiency (#309). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.2%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Wofford Terriers operate at a 68.7 tempo (#198), while VMI Keydets play at 67.6 (#236). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.1) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Wofford Terriers shoot 50.7% on two-pointers, while VMI Keydets convert at 47.5%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Wofford Terriers's free throw rate sits at 37.0, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. VMI Keydets check in at 32.0, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Wofford Terriers convert 72.6% while VMI Keydets hit 71.2%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, VMI Keydets get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Wofford Terriers. 
From a coaching perspective, Kevin Giltner leads Wofford Terriers while Andrew Wilson guides VMI Keydets. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match.
