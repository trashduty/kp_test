<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
East Carolina Pirates (7-16) hosts UTSA Roadrunners (4-19) at Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into East Carolina Pirates favored by 10.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 10.5 points tells us East Carolina Pirates has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. UTSA Roadrunners needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>UTSA Roadrunners</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 94.32 (ranked #354 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 27.9% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>East Carolina Pirates</strong> counter with 99.34 offensive efficiency (#321). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 27.9%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
UTSA Roadrunners operate at a 69.9 tempo (#122), while East Carolina Pirates play at 69.0 (#171). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 69.4) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, UTSA Roadrunners shoot 45.7% on two-pointers, while East Carolina Pirates convert at 46.2%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. UTSA Roadrunners's free throw rate sits at 30.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. East Carolina Pirates check in at 39.3, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, UTSA Roadrunners convert 69.8% while East Carolina Pirates hit 69.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, East Carolina Pirates get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—UTSA Roadrunners is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Austin Claunch leads UTSA Roadrunners while Mike Schwartz guides East Carolina Pirates. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>
This looks like a mismatch on paper with East Carolina Pirates significantly higher in the rankings, but as they say, that's why they play the games. UTSA Roadrunners will need their best performance to stay competitive. 
</p>

<strong>Key Matchup: The Battle in the Trenches</strong>

<p>
Both teams are fairly evenly matched on both ends of the floor. This could come down to execution in crunch time. 
</p>

<h2>UTSA Roadrunners</h2>

<p>
