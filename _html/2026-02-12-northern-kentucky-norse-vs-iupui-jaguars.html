The early betting action has shaped into Northern Kentucky Norse favored by 5.5 points, with the total sitting at 163.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Northern Kentucky Norse is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. IUPUI Jaguars has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 163.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Northern Kentucky Norse</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 112.30 (ranked #95 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 32.6% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>IUPUI Jaguars</strong> counter with 107.16 offensive efficiency (#194). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

Getting to the line matters too. Northern Kentucky Norse's free throw rate sits at 34.5, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. IUPUI Jaguars check in at 21.9, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Northern Kentucky Norse convert 73.3% while IUPUI Jaguars hit 71.7%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
