<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen (19-6) enters hostile territory as they take on Bucknell Bison (8-17) at Sojka Pavilion in what the oddsmakers see as a significant talent gap. The early betting action has shaped into Navy Midshipmen favored by 7.5 points, with the total sitting at 134.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Navy Midshipmen has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Bucknell Bison needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 134.5 suggests a defensive slugfest or slower tempo that limits possessions. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Navy Midshipmen</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.14 (ranked #139 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. Their 34.9% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Bucknell Bison</strong> counter with 99.20 offensive efficiency (#324). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.2%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Navy Midshipmen operate at a 65.6 tempo (#319), while Bucknell Bison play at 67.0 (#257). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.3) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Navy Midshipmen shoot 52.8% on two-pointers, while Bucknell Bison convert at 49.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Navy Midshipmen's free throw rate sits at 38.8, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Bucknell Bison check in at 32.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Navy Midshipmen convert 73.9% while Bucknell Bison hit 77.1%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Bucknell Bison get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. Combined with their ranking advantage, this home court could create an intimidating environment for Navy Midshipmen. 
From a coaching perspective, Jon Perry leads Navy Midshipmen while John Griffin guides Bucknell Bison. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
