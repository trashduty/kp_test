These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Grambling St Tigers's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 140.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Grambling St Tigers</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.08 (ranked #315 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.8% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Texas Southern Tigers</strong> counter with 101.12 offensive efficiency (#305). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
