<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Iona Gaels (16-13) hosts Rider Broncs (4-23) at Hynes Athletics Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Iona Gaels favored by 12.5 points, with the total sitting at nan. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 12.5-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking Rider Broncs to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Iona Gaels to play below their standard. The total of nan points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Rider Broncs</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 95.96 (ranked #350 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 28.3% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Iona Gaels</strong> counter with 106.12 offensive efficiency (#222). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 35.2% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Rider Broncs operate at a 65.4 tempo (#321), while Iona Gaels play at 68.2 (#201). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The slower pace (averaging 66.8) means fewer possessions, making each one more valuable. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Rider Broncs shoot 43.3% on two-pointers, while Iona Gaels convert at 50.7%. Iona Gaels has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Rider Broncs's free throw rate sits at 30.7, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Iona Gaels check in at 28.7, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Rider Broncs convert 70.0% while Iona Gaels hit 71.3%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Iona Gaels get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Rider Broncs is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Kevin Baggett leads Rider Broncs while Dan Geriot guides Iona Gaels. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Rider Broncs</h2>

<p>
