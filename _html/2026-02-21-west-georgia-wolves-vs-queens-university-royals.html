The early betting action has shaped into Queens University Royals favored by 11.5 points, with the total sitting at 163.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 11.5 points tells us Queens University Royals has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. West Georgia Wolves needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 163.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>West Georgia Wolves</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 104.97 (ranked #241 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 33.8% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Queens University Royals</strong> counter with 119.23 offensive efficiency (#29). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 35.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
