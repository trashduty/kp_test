These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 9.5 points tells us Mercyhurst Lakers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. St. Francis (PA) Red Flash needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close.

</p>

<strong>St. Francis (PA) Red Flash</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 96.62 (ranked #342 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 34.1% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Mercyhurst Lakers</strong> counter with 101.29 offensive efficiency (#299). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 32.0%, forcing them to grind in the half court.
