<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Wofford Terriers (17-10) hosts VMI Keydets (6-21) at Richardson Indoor Stadium in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Wofford Terriers favored by 14.0 points, with the total sitting at 154.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 14.0-point spread screams mismatch. The books are asking VMI Keydets to hang within two possessions, which based on the profiles, requires Wofford Terriers to play below their standard. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>VMI Keydets</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.40 (ranked #315 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 31.4% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Wofford Terriers</strong> counter with 114.08 offensive efficiency (#74). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. At 35.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
VMI Keydets operate at a 68.0 tempo (#214), while Wofford Terriers play at 68.9 (#170). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.4) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, VMI Keydets shoot 47.6% on two-pointers, while Wofford Terriers convert at 52.0%. Both teams are evenly matched in paint efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. VMI Keydets's free throw rate sits at 31.2, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Wofford Terriers check in at 37.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, VMI Keydets convert 72.0% while Wofford Terriers hit 72.6%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Wofford Terriers get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—VMI Keydets is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Andrew Wilson leads VMI Keydets while Kevin Giltner guides Wofford Terriers. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
