<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Bethune-Cookman Wildcats (13-13) hosts Alabama St Hornets (9-17) at Moore Gym in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
The 5.5-point spread indicates Bethune-Cookman Wildcats is viewed as the better team, but this isn't an overwhelming edge. Alabama St Hornets has a legitimate path to covering or winning outright. The total of 144.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Alabama St Hornets</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 100.51 (ranked #312 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.7% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Bethune-Cookman Wildcats</strong> counter with 102.48 offensive efficiency (#290). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 33.1% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Alabama St Hornets operate at a 71.5 tempo (#47), while Bethune-Cookman Wildcats play at 70.9 (#72). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 71.2) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
