<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles (9-14) hosts Western Illinois Leathernecks (4-19) at Eblen Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building. The early betting action has shaped into Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles favored by 8.5 points, with the total sitting at 142.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 8.5 points tells us Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Western Illinois Leathernecks needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 142.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Western Illinois Leathernecks</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 93.13 (ranked #360 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. At 29.1% from three, they can't rely on the arc. Expect a paint-focused attack. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles</strong> counter with 101.56 offensive efficiency (#294). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. The three-point shot hasn't fallen this year at 31.8%, forcing them to grind in the half court. 
</p>

<h4>Tempo & Playing Style</h4>
<p>
Western Illinois Leathernecks operate at a 67.2 tempo (#248), while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles play at 69.6 (#138). Both teams operate at similar speeds, so we shouldn't see much of a tempo conflict. The moderate pace (around 68.4) should create a standard flow. 
</p>

<h4>The Interior Battle</h4>
<p>
Inside the paint, Western Illinois Leathernecks shoot 43.2% on two-pointers, while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles convert at 49.7%. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles has a clear edge in interior scoring efficiency. 
Getting to the line matters too. Western Illinois Leathernecks's free throw rate sits at 38.7, indicating they're aggressive attacking the rim and drawing contact. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles check in at 34.4, meaning they don't manufacture easy points at the line. When they do get fouled, Western Illinois Leathernecks convert 67.2% while Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles hit 73.9%. Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles's edge at the charity stripe matters in close finishes. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
<p>
Playing at home, Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles get the crowd advantage and familiar surroundings. But despite the friendly confines, they're significant underdogs for a reason—Western Illinois Leathernecks is simply the superior team on paper. 
From a coaching perspective, Chad Boudreau leads Western Illinois Leathernecks while John Pelphrey guides Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles. Experience and game planning will be critical in what promises to be a tactical chess match. 
</p>

<h3>Game Storylines</h3>
