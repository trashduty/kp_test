<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>

Florida Gulf Coast Eagles (10-14) travels to face Bellarmine Knights (10-13) at Knights Hall in what shapes up to be a competitive matchup. The early betting action has shaped into Florida Gulf Coast Eagles favored by 1.5 points, with the total sitting at 154.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles's 1.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 154.5 points to a track meet. The books are anticipating fireworks with both teams getting their shots up. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Florida Gulf Coast Eagles</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 110.02 (ranked #141 nationally). They're solid offensively, capable of putting up points but not overwhelming. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.2% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Bellarmine Knights</strong> counter with 116.72 offensive efficiency (#56). They're competent on offense without being spectacular. They're lethal from beyond the arc at 36.6%, giving them spacing and shot creation.

Getting to the line matters too. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles's free throw rate sits at 30.4, suggesting they're more perimeter-oriented or struggle to draw fouls. Bellarmine Knights check in at 36.0, showing they also get to the stripe frequently. When they do get fouled, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles convert 73.8% while Bellarmine Knights hit 77.5%. Both teams are comparable from the stripe.
