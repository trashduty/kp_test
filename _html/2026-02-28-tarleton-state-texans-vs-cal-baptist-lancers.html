<h3>Game Analysis & Betting Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
<p>
Cal Baptist Lancers (20-8) hosts Tarleton State Texans (14-15) at Fowler Events Center in a game where the home team finds itself as the underdog in their own building.

These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread around 7.5 points tells us Cal Baptist Lancers has clear advantages, but games aren't played on paper. Tarleton State Texans needs to punch above their weight class to keep this close. The total of 137.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Tarleton State Texans</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 101.68 (ranked #302 nationally). Scoring has been a struggle, and they'll need their best offensive showing to hit their number. Their 32.3% three-point shooting is serviceable but won't scare anyone. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Cal Baptist Lancers</strong> counter with 105.48 offensive efficiency (#240). Points have been hard to come by, making every possession critical. At 32.5% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>

<h4>X-Factors & Intangibles</h4>
