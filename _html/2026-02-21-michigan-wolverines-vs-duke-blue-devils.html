The early betting action has shaped into Michigan Wolverines favored by 2.5 points, with the total sitting at 148.5. These numbers tell us a story, but let's dig deeper into what's really happening on the court.
</p>

<h4>Breaking Down the Spread</h4>
<p>
A spread under 3 points suggests the books see this as essentially a coin flip. Michigan Wolverines's 2.5-point cushion reflects home court advantage more than a talent gap. The total of 148.5 sits right around league average, indicating a standard pace without extreme scoring expectations either way. 
</p>

<h4>Offensive Firepower</h4>
<strong>Michigan Wolverines</strong> bring an offensive efficiency of 123.61 (ranked #2 nationally). This is an elite offense that can score in multiple ways. The three-ball has been a weapon, connecting at 36.1% from deep. They'll look to stretch the floor and create driving lanes through that perimeter threat. 
<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Duke Blue Devils</strong> counter with 122.14 offensive efficiency (#9). This offense can match anyone bucket-for-bucket. At 34.9% from three, they have adequate spacing but must pick their spots.

</p>

Both teams are comparable from the stripe. 
</p>
